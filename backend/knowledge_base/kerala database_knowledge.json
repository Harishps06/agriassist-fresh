Line planting facilitates roguing and giving alleyways of 30 cm after every 3 m helps in manuring, plant protection operations and supervision. Seed rate Transplanting 60-85 kg ha-1 Broadcasting 80-100 kg ha-1 Dibbling 80-90 kg ha-1 The above seed rates are specified for farmers  field on the basis of minimum germination of 80 per cent. In pokkali cultivation, for Vyttila varieties, 100 kg ha-1 may be sown on the beds or mounds formed in the field. fluorescenes   10 g kg of seeds before sowing or with the following fungicides on the previous day of sowing (12 to 16 hours ahead) at dosage given below: Carbendazim 2g per kg of seed Wet seed treatment Soak seed for 12 to 16 hours in a solution of P. Treatment with Carbendazim will protect the seedlings from blast disease up to 30 to 60 days after sowing. Nursery For transplanting, healthy seedlings have to be raised in seedbed. 14 RICE Irrigation may be commenced on the 5th day after sowing and continued up to the 7th day, to a depth of about 5 cm. Flooding the soil with too much water for long periods produces tall and weak seedlings, which do not readily recover during transplanting. Dry method This method is practised in areas where sufficient water is not available and the time of planting is uncertain. During first crop season, wherever transplanting is done depending upon receipt of rainfall, it is safer to adopt this method since growth of the seedlings can be controlled. Age of seedlings Seedlings are ready to be pulled out when they attain the stage of 4-5 leaves, about 18 days after sowing in the case of short duration varieties and 20-25 days after sowing in the case of medium duration varieties. Under ill drained conditions, long duration varieties may be planted 30 days after sowing. Wash off mud and soil from the roots carefully and tie the seedlings into bundles of convenient size for transplanting. Ensure a smooth, level field for transplanting the seedlings. Before transplanting or sowing, apply manures and fertilizers at the rates specified for the region and varieties as indicated in Table 4. Maintain a thin film of water to facilitate sowing so that the germinated seeds do not get covered with clayey soil, which affects seedling establishment. Land is ploughed thoroughly and transplanting is done. For the second crop, land is prepared thoroughly and direct sowing of sprouted seeds or transplanting is done. When the soil and weather conditions become favourable for sowing, the baskets containing the seeds are re-soaked for 3 to 6 hours before sowing. Koottumundakan In this system of rice cultivation, a mixture of seeds of a non-photosensitive (virippu) variety and a photosensitive (mundakan) variety of rice in the proportion 70:30 (w w) is sown during virippu season. This system is practiced in areas where sowing   planting of mundakan crop is not possible due to excess water in the field. No cultivation is practised after the harvest of first crop season variety. Though the yield will be less than that of the two independent crops, this type of cultivation is taken up in view of the special circumstances prevailing in such areas. Transplanting Transplant seedlings of appropriate age for the variety   2-3 seedlings per hill in rows, at spacing as shown in Table 5. SRI (System of Rice Intensification) is a method of rice cultivation introduced by French priest Fr. Green crop manuring Cowpea may be raised as an intercrop in dry seeded low land (semi-dry) rice by sowing 12. 0 kg ha-1 at 30-40 days after sowing without affecting the yield with a substantial reduction on weed incidence. Wet seeded rice In wet seeded rice, daincha can be raised as an intercrop by sowing 20 kg seed of daincha ha-1 along with rice (seed rate 60 kg ha-1) to serve as a source of green manure. 0 kg ha-1 at 30 days after sowing thereby adding substantial quantity of green manure. For modan cultivation (upland crop) and direct seeded crop in wet lands, apply nitrogen in three equal split doses, first as basal dressing, second at tillering stage (three weeks after seeding) and the third at panicle initiation stage (about thirty days before flowering).

During the first crop season, when basal application of nitrogen is not possible due to incessant rains, basal dose can be shifted to 15 days after transplanting. In coarse sandy loam soils with high percolation as in Onattukara region, nitrogen and potash fertilizers may be applied in five equal splits at planting, 15th, 38th, 53rd and 70th day for medium duration varieties which coincide with the stages of early tillering, neck node differentiation, early reduction division and heading stages respectively in the case of medium duration varieties. The organics may be incorporated 3 weeks before transplanting. Methods of fertilizer application For pre-planting application, apply the fertilizers at the final ploughing. Apply lime   600 kg ha-1 in two split doses, the first dose of 350 kg ha-1 as basal dressing at the time of first ploughing and the second dose of 250 kg ha-1 as top dressing about one month after sowing transplanting. 5 cm during transplanting. The date of planting may be adjusted so as to avoid synchronization of the critical stages of maximum tillering or heading with the usual flood period in the tract. Stale seed bed technique: After land preparation, withhold sowing and allow the weedy rice seeds in the top layers of the soil to germinate. Pre sowing herbicide application to prevent the establishment of weedy rice seedlings After land preparation, drain the field to retain only a thin film of water. Management of Salvinia molesta (African payal) Trampling salvinia in situ in the wet lands a week before transplanting will control the weed and add to soil fertility. Planting to pre-tillering 1. 2 per cent chlorpyrifos solution for 3 h before sowing. 02 per cent chlorpyrifos suspension for 12 h prior to planting. 5 kg ai ha) within 10 days after sowing. Avoid overlapping cultivation in an Ela. Very close planting leads to enhanced attack. Use tolerant varieties for cultivation. In Kuttanad tract, early planting of paddy in September-October is advisable, wherever possible. Rice thrips (Stenchaetothrips biformis) Symptoms The crop is highly susceptible in the nursery stage for the first 23-25 days after transplanting sowing. 2 per cent dimethoate for six hours before transplanting in tracts where nematode attack is detected. It affects the crop in early stages of growth in nurseries and upto 3-4 weeks after transplanting. When the field preparation and planting are done on rainy seasons, postpone the application of the basal dose of nitrogen to the early tillering stage (10 days after planting). Observation is taken at 10 days interval from 20 days after transplanting or 25 days after sowing upto heading. Hints for reducing cost of cultivation 1. 5 cm), as shallow planting increases the tillering of seedlings. One weeding thoroughly on the 30th day after sowing is ideal. 5 kg ha-1 ) one week after transplanting   Foliar spray (10g l-1) after one month is effective for the management of sheath blight for upland rice. 5 kg ha-1) one week after transplanting   Foliar spray (10g l-1) one month after transplanting is effective for the management of blast, sheath blight, brown spot, sheath rot, glume discolouration and bacterial blight of rice. Mechanical Transplanting in Rice A. When seedlings reach a height of 150 mm, mat is ready for transplanting. Final preparation may be done on the day of transplanting in case of sandy loam soil, but may be done 3-4 days prior to planting in case of clayey soils, depending upon settling time of the puddle to consolidate. A thin film of water only is needed in the main field at the time of transplanting. The important components in the IPM are the use of tolerant  resistant varieties, regulating planting density, adjusting the time of planting   sowing, group farming practices, cultural management of pests, integrated nutrient management, removal of weeds, use of botanical pesticides and preservation of natural enemies. The parasitoids have to be released 15-30 days after transplantation or 25-30 days after sowing or immediately after noticing moth activity in the field. Seeds and sowing Seed rate: 20 kg ha-1 Plough the land three times and prepare ridges and furrows. Apply 1 3 nitrogen, 30-40 days and the rest 60-70 days after sowing. After cultivation Hand hoeing and weeding on the 21st and 45th day after sowing.

However, lime pelleted seeds can be stored up to one week in a cool place prior to sowing. Weed management : Pre-emergence application (0-3 days after sowing) of Pretilachlor   0. If broadcasting is adopted, the seeds can be sown broadcast over the field and channels drawn after sowing. Sowing Plough the land thoroughly 2-3 times and remove weeds and stubbles. The remaining nitrogen may be applied 15-20 days after sowing. After cultivation Hoeing at the time of application of the second dose of nitrogen will give adequate aeration to the soil and help the root system to spread easily. , at 15 days after sowing and at the time of flowering.

Seeds and sowing Seed rate Pure crop 20-25 kg ha-1 Mixed crop 6 kg ha-1 Sowing Plough the land 2-3 times thoroughly and remove weeds and stubbles. The remaining quantity of N (10 kg) can be applied as foliar spray of 2 per cent urea solution in two equal doses on the 15th and 30th day after sowing. GREEN PEA (Pisum sativum) Seeds and sowing Adopt seed rate of 60 kg ha and spacing of 15-20 cm between rows and 10 cm between plants. Line sowing is helpful for training the vines on standards. For early-sown crop, raised beds of 1 m width and 5 cm height may be prepared for sowing the seeds. Season: September-October Variety: Co-1 and Pattambi Local AK-21 and AK- 42 (Photo insensitive varieties) Seeds and sowing Seed rate: 25-30 kg ha-1 Sowing After land preparation, sow the seeds either dibbled in rows 25 cm apart or by broadcast. Season Sowing can be done in two seasons. In soils of medium fertility, top dressing of nitrogen   30 kg ha-1 four weeks after sowing is essential. After cultivation Weed the plots four weeks after sowing and 50 days later. Plant protection Soak the seeds before sowing in a copper- based fungicide solution. Variety: SA 1 Seeds and sowing Seed rate Pure crop 15-20 kg ha-1 Mixed crop 6-7 kg ha-1 Sowing When sown with groundnut, spacing recommended between rows is 3 to 3. Manuring Lime 500 kg ha-1 Cattle manure 3000 kg ha-1 N 40 kg ha-1 P2O5 80 kg ha-1 After cultivation Weeding and intercultivation once in three weeks will ensure a good crop. Well-drained sandy or clay loams and alluviums with good fertility are generally suitable for the cultivation of the crop. When taking up cultivation in a new area, inoculation with the culture of Rhizobium is desirable. Sowing after the onset of heavy showers will result in poor germination and growth. Seeds and sowing Seeds may be sown either in lines 45 cm apart at a distance of 10 cm between seeds in a row or by giving a plant-to-plant distance of 20 cm. After cultivation Weed the plots once or twice depending on weed growth. As the crop smothers the field after initial growth, weed control will be necessary only up to 30-40 days after sowing. Harvesting and yield The crop will be ready for harvest in about 4 months after sowing. If it is not for sowing, the seed may be stored for up to three years after drying. Seeds and sowing Tuber cut-pieces having a portion of central bud and weighing about 1 kg are ideal for planting. Dip the pieces in cowdung slurry and allow to dry under shade before planting. After planting, cover the pit with dried leaves or other mulching materials. About 12,000 cut pieces weighing about 12 t are required for planting one hectare. Most of the seed material will germinate within one month after planting. Avoid planting corms already infested. Minisett technique for quality planting materials Minisetts weighing 100 g each can be planted directly in nursery beds or in the main field with the central bud portion facing up at a spacing of 60 cm x 45 cm. After cultivation Apply full dose of P2O5 and half the dose N and K2O (N:P2O5:K2O   50:50:75 kg ha-1) after forty five days of planting along with intercultivation and weeding. Apply second dose of fertilizers (N and K2O   50:75 kg ha-1) one month after the first application along with intercultivation and earthing up. Harvesting The crop will be ready for harvest 8-9 months after planting. Use of organically produced planting materials. Treatment of corm pieces of 500-750 g with slurry containing cowdung, neem cake and Trichoderma harzianum (20g kg-1 seed) and drying under shade before planting. Schot)   Application of Trichoderma harzianum incorporated FYM   36 t ha-1 (3 kg pit-1) in pits at the time of planting (FYM, neem cake mixture (10:1) inoculated with Trichoderma harzianum   2. 0 t ha-1 (80-85 g pit-1 ) in pits at the time of planting. Inter-sowing of green manure cowpea (seed rate   20 kg ha-1 ) between elephant foot yam pits and incorporation of green matter in pits at 45-60 days. Seeds and sowing Healthy cormels of 50-100 g weight and 20-25 cm long and cut corms of 150-200 g size are commonly used. For planting one hectare, 1. While planting the cut pieces of the main corm or suckers, it is advisable to keep the apical portion above the ground level. Planting on ridges or mounds is often recommended since tuber formation is improved when adequate drainage is provided. A spacing of 90 X 90 cm is usually practiced with a planting density of 12,345 ELEPHANT FOOT YAM AND XANTHOSOMA 54 plants ha-1 and pits converted to mounds is the usual method of planting. Manuring Soil amendment (dolomite), cattle manure and NPK  1 ton ha-1, 25 tons ha-1 and 80:50:150 kg ha-1 respectively is recommended for cultivation. Apply dolomite during first land preparation alteast 15 days before planting. To meet the remaining 75  Nitrogen sow green manure cowpea in the interspaces   20 kg ha-1 immediately after planting tannia and incorporate at 45-60 days. Application of N bio-fertilizer   10 g per plant within one month of planting and application of neem cake in pits after one month of the bio-fertilizer application has to be done. Chemical N (25 ) and Kare applied in 3 splits of 2,4 and 6 months after planting. After cultivation Weeding and earthing up should be done twice at 1 and 2 months after planting. Mulching As the crop respond well to mulching, after planting, green leaf mulching  15 tons per ha was found beneficial for maximum corm as well as cormel production. Use of disease free planting materials can avoid the incidence of this problem. Harvesting Crop can be harvested when older leaves start yellowing and drying usually during 9-11 months of planting. Seeds and sowing Use side tubers each of 25-35 g for planting. Mulching Soon after planting, cover the ridges with suitable mulching materials for retention of moisture and to control weeds. Manuring Apply cattle manure or compost   12 t ha-1 as basal dressing, while preparing the ridges for planting. After cultivation Inter-cultivation is essential in colocasia. Weeding, light hoeing and earthing up are required at 30-45 days and 60-75 days after planting. Irrigation Ensure sufficient moisture in the soil at the time of planting. For uniform sprouting, irrigate just after planting and one week later. Harvesting Colocasia becomes ready for harvest five to six months after planting. COLOCASIA 56 Storage of seed material The side tubers to be used as planting materials are usually separated from the mother corm and stored. Organic Farming of Taro Application of FYM   15 t ha-1 in pits at the time of planting (400 g plant -1), application of neem cake  1 t ha-1 in pits at the time of planting (30 g plant-1), application of biofertilizers Azospirillum   3 kg ha -1, mycorrhiza   5 kg ha -1 and phospho bacteria   3 kg ha-1, inter- sowing of green manure cowpea (seed rate   20 kg ha-1) between yam mounds and incorporation of green matter at 45-60 days. If the planting is delayed, yams start sprouting in storage, which is not desirable for planting. Seeds and sowing D. Dip the pieces in cowdung slurry and allow to dry under the shade before planting. Harvesting The crop becomes ready for harvest within 8-9 months after planting when the vines are completely dried up. Planting season and manuring are also similar. Seeds and sowing Select medium size tubers weighing about 100-150 g each. Tuber yields of 20-25 t ha-1 can be obtained by following the improved methods of cultivation. The minisetts are then spread out under light shade for an hour with cut surface facing up before planting them in the nursery seed beds. Organic Farming of Yams (Greater Yam, Lesser Yam, White Yam   Dwarf White Yam) Use of organically produced planting materials, application of FYM   15 t ha  1 in pits at the time of planting (1. 5 kg plant  1), application of neem cake  1 t ha  1 in pits at the time of planting (80 g plant  1), application of biofertilizers, Azospirillum   3 kg ha  1, mycorrhiza  5 kg ha  1 and 1 phospho bacteria   3 kg ha  1 (for dwarf white yam Azospi- rillum   3 kg ha  1 and mycorrhiza   5 kg ha  1), inter-sowing of green manure cowpea (seed rate   20 kg ha  1) between yam mounds and incorporation of green matter at 45-60 days (green matter addition from the green manure  15-20 t ha  1), application of ash  1. Seeds and sowing Sweet potato is propagated by means of vine cuttings. 80 kg of medium sized weevil free tubers (each of 125-150 g) are required for planting in the primary nursery area (100 m2 to plant one hectare). Apply urea 15 days after planting   1. To ensure better plant growth in the secondary nursery, 5 kg of urea has to be applied in two split doses on 15th and 30th day after planting. Vines obtained from the freshly harvested crop are also planted in similar nursery area to obtain sufficient planting material. Cuttings obtained from the apical and near apical portions of the vines are preferable for planting in the main field. Storing of cut sweet potato vines with intact leaves, in bundles covered with banana leaves (dipped in water) and kept under shade for two days prior to planting is recommended. Vines will be ready for planting on the 45th day. Make ridges 25-35 cm high, 60 cm apart for planting vines. Apply N in two equal split doses, the first at the time of planting and the second 4-5 weeks after planting. Apply full dose of P2O5 and K2O at the planting time. Irrigation When grown as irrigated crop, provide irrigation once in 2 days for a period of 10 days after planting and thereafter once in 7-10 days. After cultivation Conduct two weeding and earthing up operations about 2 weeks and 5 weeks after planting. The top dressing of fertilizers may be done along with the second after cultivation. b) Use healthy and weevil-free planting materials. 5   4 months after planting. However, at the time of planting there must be sufficient moisture for the plant to establish itself. Season The main planting seasons are April-May with the onset of southwest monsoon and September-October with the onset of north- east monsoon. Planting can also be done during February-April, provided sufficient moisture is made available through irrigation. For maximum tuber production, April-May planting is preferred because the crop can effectively utilize both the monsoons. Seeds and sowing Tapioca is propagated by stem cuttings. About 2000 stems are required for planting one hectare. Pit, flat, ridge or mound method of planting can be adopted depending upon soil type, topography of land and elevation so that waterlogging is avoided. Pit followed by mound is found to be the best method of planting. Adopt square method of planting at a spacing of 90 cm x 90 cm   one cutting per pit. Gap filling should be done within 15 days after planting preferably with longer setts of 40 cm length. Land preparation Before planting, plough the field 2-3 times or dig to a depth 25-30 cm depending upon soil type to establish a deep porous field in which the setts are to be planted. Minisett planting technique for quality planting material For producing minisetts, mature, disease free stems preferably those obtained from indexed meristem culture should be selected. An area of 220 m2 nursery is required for producing minisetts for planting one hectare of land. The minisetts will be ready for transplanting in about three to four weeks time. After the basal application of recommended manure in the main field, ridges of 30 cm height are taken with a spacing of 45 cm between the ridges and planting is done on the ridges at a spacing of 45 cm. , 1 3 basal, 1 3 two months after planting and 1 3 three months after planting. The remaining quantity of N and K2O may be applied 45 days after planting at the time of intercultivation. 5 kg ha-1 (1g plant-1) in small channels around the mounds within 2 months of planting cassava providing an interval of 2 weeks between the application of these fertilizer enhances tuber yield and quality. After cultivation Keep the field free of weeds and maintain soil loose by 2-3 shallow diggings or hoeing upto 90 days after planting followed by light earthing up. Retain two shoots on each plant in opposite directions and remove excess shoots about 30 days after planting. However, the crop has to be irrigated to provide sufficient moisture TAPIOCA 64 under conditions of prolonged dry periods after planting. The best season for sowing groundnut is May-June. Immediately after planting of tapioca setts, groundnut seeds are sown at a spacing of 30 cm between rows and 20 cm within rows, so that two rows of groundnut can be accommodated in between two rows of cassava. Only well-matured and bold seeds are to be selected for sowing. One month after sowing of the seed, 20 kg each P2O5 and K2O and 10 kg N   ha-1 may be given to the intercrop along with earthing up. , 40-45 days after sowing) the soil should not be disturbed, as it will affect the pod development adversely. As a rule, only stem cuttings from disease free plants should be used for planting to minimize the spread of the virus disease. For this purpose, tagging of disease free healthy plants for selection as planting materials must be practised from September to December. Production of disease free planting material of tapioca through nursery techniques Setts of 3 to 4 node cuttings from apparently disease free plants are collected and planted in the nursery at a very close spacing of 4 x 4 cm so that about 500 setts can be accommodated in one square metre land. Screening of CMD symptoms may be started 10 days after planting. Termites To control termites infesting planted setts, sprinkle chlorpyrifos in the mounds prior to planting. Harvesting Tapioca becomes ready for harvest 9-10 months after planting. A well-drained medium fertile soil is suitable for its cultivation. Suphala   A tissue culture mutant derived by KAU from local cultivar suited for year round cultivation with a duration of 120 - 140 days. Nursery Raise the nursery approximately one month before planting. Take the vine cutting to a length of 10-15 cm from the top portion after three weeks from planting. Planting Plant the vine cutting collected from the nursery on ridges at a spacing of 30 cm or on raised beds at 30 cm x 15 cm spacing. Topdress with N and K2O at the rate of 30 and 50 kg ha-1 respectively at 45 days after planting. After cultivation Give weeding and earthing up, at 45 days after planting along with topdressing. Harvesting Harvest the crop 5 months after planting. Planting materials Cashew can be propagated by seedlings, air layers and softwood grafts. Hence softwood grafts, which give a high rate of establishment and early flowering, are recommended for planting (Table 15). Propagation by air layering Prepare air layers during February-March, so that they will be ready for planting in June- July. The seed nuts should be soaked in water overnight before sowing. Water the bags immediately after sowing and daily thereafter. Nuts usually germinate within 15-20 days after sowing during monsoon months and within 8-10 days during dry months. The grafts will be ready for planting 5-6 months after grafting. Planting and management of grafts The softwood grafts will be ready for plant- ing in 5-6 months after grafting. Care should be taken while planting to see that the graft union is 2. Staking should be done immediately after planting to avoid lodging. 71 CASHEW Planting and management of plantation Plant softwood grafts in pits of size 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm during June-July. Planting may be done at a spacing of 7. Initial training   shape pruning The sprouts coming from the rootstock portion of the graft, that is from the portion below the graft joint, should be removed frequently during the first year of planting. This can be achieved by removing the side shoots or side branches gradually as the plants start growing from the second year of planting. Proper staking of the plants is required to avoid lodging due to wind during the initial years of planting. The flower panicles emerging from the grafts during the first and second year of planting should also be removed (de-blossoming) in order to allow the plant to put up good vegetative growth. High density planting High density planting is a technique recommended for enhancing the productivity of cashew plantations. This technique involves planting more number of grafts per unit area and thinning at later stages. Instead of the normal planting density of 64 to 177 plants per hectare (spacing ranging from 7. 5 to 10 m in the square system of planting) or 74 to 204 CASHEW 72 73 CASHEW plants (spacing ranging from 7. 5 to 10 m in the triangular system of planting), 312 to 625 grafts will be planted per hectare, initially. While adopting a high density planting technique, grafts may be planted initially at a spacing of 4 m x 4 m or 8 m x 4 m so that there will be 625 or 312 plants respectively. High density planting would be more useful in poor soils where the rate of canopy expansion is slow. If uniform management practices are adopted, during early years of yield, the per tree nut yield will be more or less the same with all the trees, in both the conventional system of planting and in high density planting. For organic cashew cultivation, pongamia oil   2 ml l or Beaveria bassiana   20 g l can be sprayed. Preparation of land and sowing Plough the land three to four times and form ridges and furrows. Note: Treat the seeds with carbendazim 50 WP (2 g kg-1) or Trichoderma viride talc preparation (4 g kg-1) before sowing. Top dress with 35 kg N per ha-1 about 45 days after sowing. After cultivation Thin the crop when the plants are 15 to 20 cm high, retaining two seedlings per hill. Rubber grows in a wide range of soils however, deep well drained soils free from underlying sheet rocks are well suited for the cultivation of rubber. Budded plants: Either poly bag or root trainer plants can be used for planting Approved cultivars The planting material recommendation of the Rubber Board is based on a multi clone concept. Realizing the potential risk involved in monoclonal planting, the Board from 1991, has been recommending planting of as many clones as practicable, out of a select list of desirable clones. Harvesting The bolls start bursting 100-120 days after sowing and will be ready for harvest at this stage. PB 311 is wind susceptible hence planting of this clone in wind prone areas is to be avoided. Planting materials suitable for North Konkan RRIM 600, RRII 208, RRII 105, RRII 6, RRII 5, PB 260, PR 255 and RRIC 100 perform well in this region. Lifesaving irrigation is to be given to all clonal plantings in the first three years. For cultivation under rainfed unirrigated conditions, polyclonal seedlings are the best choice. Category 1 consists of clones officially released by the Rubber Board of India for planting in large areas. 5 NPKMg mixture and 118 kg magnesium sulphate per hectare 6   8 weeks after planting is recommended. Bud wood nursery Bud wood nursery is raised by planting polybag plants or budded stumps of authentic planting materials of desired clones at a spacing of 90 x 60 cm. Before planting, bud wood nurseries are given a basal dose 165 kg of powdered rock phosphate per hectare (1. Two to three months after planting, 125 g of 10-10-4-1. A second application at the same rate is given 8 to 9 months after planting. The first harvest of brown bud wood is done one year after planting by cutting the shoot 30 cm above the bud union. These clones are recommended for only experimental planting on a limited scale not to exceed 15 per cent of the total area in aggregate. Polyclonal seeds are also included in this category and recommended for planting in marginal areas. Prophylactic protection against diseases is recommended for the cultivation of all these clones. As rubber seed viability is very short, seeds are collected for planting soon after fruit dehision. The spacing adopted for planting in seedling nurseries are 23 x 23 cm (for green budding) and 30 x 30 cm (for brown budding). Planting materials The generally used planting materials are seedling stumps, budded stumps, polybag plants and root trainer plants. 83 RUBBER RUBBER 84 Polybag plants: Polybag plants are raised either by budding seedlings that are developed by in situ planting of seeds (in polybags) or by planting budded stumps in polybags. The potting medium should be packed well inside the root trainer cup before planting seeds. Planting Planting should be done with the onset of monsoon when the weather conditions are ideal with sufficient rains. Spacing: The density of planting recom- mended is 420-520 plants per hectare (170 to 200 acre). Lining: In flat or slightly undulating areas, square or rectangular planting can be adopted. For rectangular planting, lines should be taken east-west to get maximum sunlight. Contour lining is done on undulating and hilly lands by marking out the planting points in contour lines across the slope. In order to reduce erosion further and to facilitate rain water infiltration trenches of about 120 cm length, 45 cm width and 60 cm depth are taken along with contour in between the planting rows. In soils with a depth of one meter or more, planting can be done in small pits dug to accommodate polybag plants. However in hard soils, planting should be done in larger pits of size 75 cm3 or 90 cm3 depending on hardness. Field planting Seed-at-stake: Two to three germinated seeds are directly planted in the centre of the refilled pit. Seedling and budded stumps: Planting of seedling and budded stumps should be done immediately after pulling out. While planting budded stumps, the bud patch should be just above the ground level to reduce the effect of elephant foot and infection by soil-borne Table 19. Polybag plants: At the time of planting, the top whorl of leaves of the plant should be fully mature. A planting hole slightly bigger than the size of the polybag is made. Root trainer plants: At the time of planting, the root plug can be separated from the container without any damage by inverting it and giving a gentle tap of the rim of the root trainer on any hard surface. A planting hole can be made in the refilled planting pit by pressing the empty root trainer container into soil. The root plug is carefully inserted into the planting hole and the soil around is compacted. Young plants during the year of planting are provided with artificial shade during summer with plated coconut leaves or gunny bags. Therefore, pre- sowing treatment is done to ensure uniformity and higher percentage of germination. As zinc deficiency is commonly noticed especially in young rubber, zinc sulphate application   25 kg ha or 50g plant mixed with equal quantity of farm yard manure or top soil (for uniform distribution) two weeks after the post monsoon fertilizer application during the year of planting is advocated as an ad hoc recommendation. In the year of planting, fertilizer application is done 2-3 months after planting ie. The second application (9 months after planting) should be done in a circular band of 45 cm width leaving 15 cm around the plant base. Season The normal planting season is October- December. Delay in planting reduces cane yield. The planting season for semi-arid tract is from October-December and in deltaic areas the ideal time is the first fortnight of January. Planting should not be delayed beyond February in the plains. In hilly tracts where sugarcane is cultivated under rainfed conditions, planting should be done after abatement of heavy rains. Planting Plant setts end to end in the furrow, with the eye buds facing sideways and cover with soil. 5 (Madhuri, Thirumadhuram, Madhurima and Madhumathi ) Chittoor area : 225:75:75 Newly cleared forest areas: 115:75:90 Apply organic manures such as compost  cattle manure pressmud as basal dose preferably in furrows and mix well with soil before planting. Apply N and K2O in two split doses, the first 45 days after planting and the second 90 days after planting along with earthing up. Do not apply N beyond 100 days after planting. After cultivation When ratoon crop of sugarcane is trash mulched   4t ha-1 the crop must be given only 100 per cent of the recommended dose of NPK 225:75:75 against the existing recommendation of 125 per cent. The crop should be weeded twice on 45 and 90 days after planting before application of fertilizers. In such cases, sow the pulse crop on the ridges one month in advance, so that the first inter- cultivation is not hindered. Management Use pest free setts for planting. Adhere to clean cultivation. To control the fungal diseases, in general, dip the cut ends of setts in copper oxychloride 2 g l-1 solution before planting. Polybag settlings are produced by planting single budded setts in polythene covers containing potting mixture and transplanted at 45-60 DAP. Hybrids Anandaganga, Keraganga and Kerasankara are recommended for general cultivation both under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Since the performance of Chandrasankara is markedly superior to that of WCT in root (wilt) affected areas, cultivation of Chandrasankara and Kalparaksha are preferred in such areas. Chandralaksha, Lakshaganga, Chandra- kalpa and Kalpadhenu are recommended for cultivation under drought prone areas. If the mother palms are the progeny of elite planting material and gives consistently higher yields for a period of not less than 6 years, seed nuts can be collected from such palms. Store seeds in shade for a minimum period of 60 days prior to sowing in nursery. Before sowing, examine seed nuts and discard those without nut water and rotten kernels. Method of planting seed nuts Plant the seed nuts in the beds in trenches 25-30 cm deep and cover with soil so that top 97 COCONUT portion of husk alone is visible. Vertical planting is preferable on account of convenience in transporting and lesser risk of seedling injury. Selection of seedlings Remove seed nuts, which do not germinate within 6 months after sowing as well as those with dead sprouts. Since early germination is one of the criteria for the selection of seedlings, the storing and sowing of seed nuts should be in lots rather than in a staggered manner. Preparation of land and planting of seedlings The nature of preparation of land before planting depends upon topography of land, soil type and other environmental factors. In reclaimed kayal areas, planting can be done on the field bunds. The size of pits for planting would depend upon soil types and water table. The same procedure can be adopted when planting is done on mounds or bunds. Common salt is to be applied about six months prior to planting. Spacing Spacing depends upon the planting system, soil type etc. In the hedge system of planting, the rows should be aligned in north-south direction and the seedlings planted as in the triangular system. Time of planting Planting the seedlings during May, with the onset of pre-monsoon rains is ideal. Under assured irrigation, planting can be done during April also. Shading and irrigation For the first two years from planting, irrigate   45 litres of water per seedling, once in 4 days, during dry summer months. Manuring young palms For the first three years after planting under rainfed conditions, apply fertilizers in two split doses at the rates shown in Table 23. Fertilizer requirement of young palms in relation to that of adult palms Time after planting Time of application April-June Sept-Oct. Spacing for coconut Planting system Spacing Approximate number of plants ha-1 Triangular 7. In all types of soils that are low in organic matter content (except reclaimed clayey soils and alluvial soils), apply organic matter   of 15-25 kg per palm per year during June-July from the second year of planting. Proper intercultivation provides control of weeds and creates soil mulch. Green manure and cover crops Green manure and cover crops recom- mended for cultivation in coconut gardens are: a. Tephrosia is especially suited for planting around seedling pits for summer shade and as a source of green manure in the rainy season. COCONUT 102 Casuarina (Casuarina equisetifolia) may be planted as single row intercrop, between rows of coconut during the first year of planting coconut seedlings in pits of size 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm spacing of 2m. The casuarina poles will be ready for felling  harvesting within 5-6 years of planting. GROUNDNUT (Arachis hypogaea) Seeds and sowing Pure crop 100kg kernels ha-1 Intercrop in coconut 80 kg kernels ha-1 Intercrop in tapioca 40-50 kg kernels ha-1 Plough the field three or four times into a fine tilth. Do not disturb the soil after 45 days of sowing. Varieties The only variety recommended for commercial cultivation is Tenera, which is a hybrid between Dura and Pisifera. Planting Oil palm is planted in the main field in triangular system at spacing of 9 m accommodating 140 palms per ha. Planting is preferably done at the onset of monsoon 113 GROUNDNUT AND OIL PALM during May-June. Leaf pruning Dead and diseased leaves and all inflorescences should be cut off regularly upto three years after planting. 5 to 4 years after planting. 115 OIL PALM Preparation of land and sowing Prepare the soil into a fine tilth by ploughing 2-4 times and breaking the clods. Nitrogen may be applied in split doses, 75 per cent as basal and the balance as foliar spray at 3 per cent concentration, 20-35 days after sowing keeping the discharge rate at 500 1 ha-1. Interculture After cultivation of the crop may be done twice, first at 15 days and the next 25-35 days after sowing. Season Lowland paddy field: December April (third crop) Uplands: August December Varieties For upland cultivation use varieties with long duration of 100-110 days and for low land, use varieties with duration of 80-99 days (Table 27). Do not use seeds from affected plants for sowing. IISR Avinash is resistant to rhizome rot and is highly suitable for planting in valleys. Trim the roots and separate the suckers so that the minimum planting unit consists of one grown up tiller and a growing young shoot. Provide sufficient mulch and stake each planting unit. On an average, 20 to 30 suckers   initial planting unit can be produced within one year of planting. Main field planting Cardamom plantation is raised in forests under the shade of tall trees. When open areas like marshy valleys and grasslands are selected for raising new plantation, saplings of shade trees have to be raised before planting cardamom sucker. The pits are filled with rich topsoil at least two months in advance of planting the seedlings. Planting can be done with the commence- ment of southwest monsoon, before the heavy rains. A small pit may be formed inside the pit by scooping out soil at the centre of the pit for planting single tillers. Harvesting and processing Cardamom plants normally start bearing capsules from the second year of planting. Avoid using katte-infected rhizome for planting. As a bio-control measure, inoculate suckers with native arbuscular mycorrhiza, Trichoderma and Pseudomonas fluorescens at the time of planting and apply during pre-monsoon period in established plantations (see the chapter on biocontrol agents against plant pathogens). Seeds and sowing Cinnamon is usually propagated through seeds. Planting Select seedlings with green leaf petioles. Planting is done in pits of size 60 cm x 60 cm at a spacing of 2 m x 2 m. Fill the pit with leaf mould and topsoil before planting. After cultivation Weed regularly in the early stages of growth. Harvesting and curing The plants will be ready for harvest in about 3 years after planting. suited for the cultivation of the crop. CINNAMON AND CLOVE 126 Seeds and sowing Clove is propagated through seeds obtained from fully developed fruits known as mother of clove. Seedlings can either be retained in the nursery till they attain a height of 25-30 cm when they are ready for transplanting or potted when they are six months old and transplanted after another 12-18 months. Planting Select 18 months old seedlings for planting. Prepare pits of size 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm at a spacing of 6 m x 6 m about a month in advance of planting. After cultivation Conduct weeding and intercultivation whenever necessary. Harvesting and curing The trees begin to yield from 7-8 years after planting. Preparation of land Clear the land of jungle growth and prepare for planting. Time and method of planting Vanilla is propagated by planting shoot cuttings in situ. Rooted cuttings as well as tissue culture derived plants can also be used for planting. After cultivation Vanilla cannot withstand even the slightest root disturbance. If allowed to remain on the vine further, 129 VANILLA GINGER (Zingiber officinale) Ginger is a tropical plant adapted for cultivation even in regions of subtropical climate such as the high ranges. Being an exhausting crop, ginger is not cultivated continuously in the same field but shifting cultivation is practised. The crop cannot withstand waterlogging and hence soils with good drainage are preferred for its cultivation. Avoid injury to roots during cultivation. Planting material Ginger rhizomes are used for planting. Treat the seed rhizomes similarly before planting also. Single bud sprout transplanting: A transplanting technique using single bud sprouts (about 5g) has been standardized to produce good quality planting material with reduced cost. 3 , for 30 minutes before planting after 30 days. The advantages are less planting material requirement, 500-750 kg per ha, 98   100 per cent field establishment, high cost: benefit ratio and suitability for early  delayed planting and high production technology. Season and method of planting The best time for planting ginger is during the first fortnight of April, after receipt of pre-monsoon showers. For irrigated ginger, the best suited time for planting is middle of February (for vegetable ginger). Half the quantity of N may be applied 60 days after planting. The remaining quantity of N and K2O may be applied 120 days after planting. Mulching Immediately after planting, mulch the beds thickly with green leaves   15 t ha-1. 5 t ha-1 first 44-60 days and second 90-120 days after planting. Application of dried coconut leaves as mulch in ginger beds after removing the petiole at the time of planting is also recommended. After cultivation Remove weeds by hand weeding before each mulching. Repeat weeding according to weed growth during the fifth and sixth month after planting. Inoculation with native arbuscular mycorrhiza, Trichoderma and Pseudomonas fluorescens at the time of planting is recommended as a biocontrol measure. 0 t ha-1 at planting followed by application of neem cake   1. 0 t ha-1 at 45 days after planting (DAP). Variety: IISR-Viswashree Seeds and sowing Fully ripe tree-burst fruits are selected for shade and therefore partially shaded situations can also be utilized for its cultivation. Seed material and varieties Whole or split mother rhizomes or well developed, healthy and disease free finger rhizomes weighing 15-20 g are suitable for planting. In Kerala, local varieties are used for cultivation. Season and method of planting Plant during April with the commencement of pre-monsoon showers. Apply two-third dose of nitrogen 30 days after planting and remaining N and K2O at 60 days after planting. Mulching Mulch the crop immediately after planting with green leaves   15 t ha-1. After cultivation The rhizomes germinate within 3-4 weeks. Remove weeds 45 days after planting and repeat if necessary. Earth up the crop after 60 days of planting. But when large scale cultivation is taken up, the attack of shoot borer (Conogethes punctiferalis) causes damage to the crop. The fleshy rind and the mace are removed before sowing. If there is any delay in sowing, the seeds should be kept in baskets filled with damp soil. Seeds germinate within 50-80 days after sowing. Planting Since the nutmeg trees require shade, suitable fast growing shade trees like Albizia, Erythrina etc. Selection of site Sites with slight to moderate slope are ideal for pepper cultivation, as they promote drainage. When such slopes are to be used for cultivation, the young plants may be sufficiently protected from the scorching sun during summer. Very tender and too hard portions of the shoots are to be avoided for planting. The cutting after planting should be kept under good shade. Partially composted coir pith and vermicompost (75:25) enriched with Tricho- derma (in talc formulation, 107 cfu g-1 at the rate of 10 g kg-1) is found to be an ideal potting medium for black pepper nursery for healthy planting material production using plug-trays (cell dimension of 7. After three months it will be ready for planting in the main field. Field planting Planting of standards is to be taken up in April-May with the onset of pre-monsoon showers. Acacia auriculiformis and Artocarpus heterophyllus are two multipurpose support tree species suitable for block cultivation of black pepper (Piper nigrum L. Seedlings of subabul and silver oak are to be planted 2-3 years before planting pepper. For planting pepper, prepare pits on the northern side of standards, 15 cm away from it. Management after planting If the terrain of the land is sloppy or uneven, carry out contour bunding or terracing to prevent soil erosion. Therefore, this is not recommended beyond three to four years after planting of pepper vines. Underplanting After regular bearing for about 20 years, the vines of most varieties start declining in yield. So underplanting should be attempted at about 20 years after planting or when a declining trend in yield appears. The old and senile vines can be removed 3-5 years after underplanting depending upon the growth of the young vines. 5 per cent during flowering and pin head stage of black pepper is recommended in zinc deficient areas of black pepper cultivation for increasing the yield and quality. Well rooted plants are used for field planting. Apply talc based formulation of Bacillus macerans   10g vine in basins (106 cfu  g) at the time of planting of vines or just before the monsoon period in established plantations. Biocontrol Inoculate pepper vines with native arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Trichoderma and Pseudomonas fluorescens at the time of planting in the nursery and field and apply during the pre-monsoon period in the established plantations to control foot rot. Replanting rejuvenation Total replanting has to be undertaken in gardens where the mortality is 50-60 per cent or above. Gap filling or replanting should be taken up only after a period of one year. At the time of replanting, soil drenching with copper oxychloride should be given. While replanting, farmers should be encouraged to use recommended varieties. Treat the cuttings before planting by immersing in a solution of carbendazim   mancozeb (1 g l-1) for 30 minutes and spray Bordeaux mixture (1 ) alternating with carbendazim (1 g l-1) for effective control of Colletotrichum infection in nurseries. Planting material should not be collected from such vines. Since the disease is systemic and 143 BLACK PEPPER transmitted through planting materials, avoid collecting planting materials from such vines. Seed material Whole or split mother rhizomes are used for planting. Season and method of planting Plant during April with the receipt of pre-monsoon showers. Manuring Apply cattle manure or compost as basal dose at 40 t ha-1 at the time of land preparation or by spreading over the beds after planting. Full BLACK PEPPER AND TURMERIC 146 dose of P2O5 and half dose of K2O may be applied as basal; 2 3 dose of N may be applied at 30 days after planting; and 1 3 N and remaining K2O may be applied 60 days after planting. Mulching Mulch the crop immediately after planting with green leaves   15 t ha-1. After cultivation Weed the crop thrice at 60, 120 and 150 days after planting, depending upon weed intensity. Harvest early varieties at 7-8 months, medium varieties at 8-9 months and long duration varieties at 9-10 months after planting. Planting materials Grafts prepared through soft wood grafting or side grafting and healthy seedlings raised in the nursery are used for cultivation. Hence planting of grafts is advocated as they ensure maternal characters including early bearing tendency. By the 20 th day, seeds will be ready for sowing. Germination starts in 20-25 days after sowing. Such seeds germinate in 10-12 days after sowing. In six to seven months time, seedlings will be ready for planting. Three months after grafting the plants will be ready for planting in the main field. Just before planting in the main field, leave the grafts under open condition in 10-15 days for hardening. One year old grafts can be used for field planting. Planting The plants can be raised as a pure crop or as a mixed crop in coconut and arecanut gardens. In slopes of 15 per cent or more, for planting grafts, rows are spaced at 5 to 5. For planting seedlings, rows are spaced at 8 to 12 m and at 6 to 8 m for trees in a row. Planting is generally done at the onset of monsoon showers. Under Kuttanad conditions, where bunds and channels alternate, planting can be done in between two palms. Fill the pits with topsoil and 5 kg of compost or well- decomposed cattle manure and 10 g of carbaryl 10 per cent dust, to avoid white ant attack, before planting. One month after planting, gently remove the polythene tape around the graft union. Harvest and yield Seedlings start to yield 8-10 years after planting, whereas grafts and budded seedlings give yield after 4-5 years. Selection of seedlings Select good seedlings for transplanting in the main field when they are 12-18 months old. Note: Plant characters such as girth at the collar one year after transplanting and number of nodes two years after transplanting are highly correlated with yield. Removal of plants with poor collar girth and lesser number of nodes one and two years after planting respectively, will help to increase the yield potential of plantations. Field planting Plant tall, quick growing shade trees on the southern and western sides of the plantation to provide protection from sun scorching. The planting is to be done during May-June in well-drained soils and during August-September in clayey soils. Manuring Apply green leaf and compost, each ARECANUT 152  12 kg per palm per year from first year of planting onwards, during September-October. While planting cocoa, a spacing 2. Drench the soil with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture before planting healthy seedlings. Waterlogged, saline and alkali soils are unsuitable for its cultivation. Proper shade and irrigation are essential for successful cultivation of this crop. Season There are two important planting seasons. Planting material and planting Top portions of mature vines (2-3 years old) are used for planting. Healthy cuttings of about 1 m length with three nodes are used as planting material. For planting one hectare, 20000- 25000 cuttings are required. Furrows are irrigated prior to planting. While planting, one node shall be buried in the soil and the second node should be at the ground level. This is repeated till four months after planting when the crop is ready for harvest. These improved clones are suitable for cultivation in different cocoa growing tracts of the country and also in the warm tropical areas especially under the shade of coconut. In the early life of the plants, planting of quick growing plants like banana and tapioca can provide temporary shade. Planting materials Cocoa can be propagated by seed and vegetative means. Seed propagation It is desirable to collect seeds from biclonal or polyclonal seed gardens involving superior self-incompatible parents to ensure genetic superiority of planting materials. Time of sowing Though the seeds will germinate at any time of the year, seeds may preferably be sown by December-January, so that 4-6 month old seedlings become available for planting by May-June. Method of sowing Seeds are to be sown with hilum-end down or to be sown flat. Sowing is to be as shallow as to just cover the seeds with soil. When seedlings are grown under heavy shade, hardening for 10 days by exposing to higher illumination may be necessary before transplanting. Vegetative propagation In view of the high variability exhibited by seedling progenies, vegetative propagation is preferred for large scale planting. Selection of planting materials When seedlings are used for planting, select only vigorous and healthy seedlings produced from polyclonal seed garden or selected mother plants as described earlier. When budded plants are used, select two or more clones for planting as the use of a single clone can lead to poor production due to the existence of self-incompatibility in cocoa. Time and method of planting Raising cocoa as a pure crop is not recommended especially in Kerala due to high pressure on land. The planting hole should be sufficient to hold the soil ball of the polybag. Tear off the polybags carefully, place the soil ball with the seedlings in the planting hole with minimum disturbance and press the soil around firmly. Planting should coincide with the onset of monsoon, but in places where irrigation is resorted to, flexibility in the time of planting is possible. Apply 1 3 of adult dose during the first year of planting, 2 3 during second year and full dose from the third year onwards. After cultivation During the first three or four years after planting, it is essential to keep the field free from weeds. Sowing Germination bed (primary): Seeds are sown in raised seed beds (15 cm above the ground level) provided with proper drainage prepared out of soil, compost and sand at 6:2:1 proportion. Planting materials Old arabica varieties like Kents and Coorgs are more susceptible to the leaf rust disease (Hemileia vastatrix). A thin layer of soil is spread after sowing and covered with dry straw to a thickness of about 5 cm to ensure uniform temperature and to regulate moisture retention. Sowing is to be taken up in December-January for arabica and in February-March for Robusta. Prior to transplanting, the nursery basket is watered and a vertical hole of 5 cm deep is made in the soil at the centre of the basket. At the time of transplanting it is preferable to slightly nip off the taproot of the seedling. Transplanting is done preferably in the early morning hours or late in the afternoon. Transplanting is done at button stage. If the taproot is bent or excessively grown, it is nipped off while transplanting. Planting in field Disease free and vigorous seedlings are selected for planting. It is wise to maintain both types of nurseries and have planting seasons, June and September. Planting shade trees  Dadap is commonly used as a lower canopy shade only in arabicas which require two tier canopy. Preplanting treatment of the base of cutting with IBA (indole butyric acid) at 5000 ppm enhances early rooting. Cuttings will root in 3-4 months after planting. After cultivation Grass and other weeds should be eradicated in the first year itself by digging or using appropriate weedicide depending on the nature of the weeds. Centering and desuckering are to be carried out for about 5 or 6 years after planting. Under certain circumstances, multiple stem system is also adopted as in the case of replanted fields or when under-planting is taken up keeping the old plants under multiple stem system. Before sowing, seeds are put in water and only the sinkers will be used and floaters rejected. The plants will be ready for planting in the main field in nine months. Field preparation In the case of new planting, in order to avoid the incidence of root diseases, after felling the trees, remove the root system to the extent possible. In the case of replanting, remove old Grevillea (silver oak) after ring barking, leaving the young ones in the field. Style of planting Up and down :1. 2 m (6800 plants ha-1) Contour planting, single hedge:1. 75 m (10,800 plants ha-1) Contour planting, double hedge: 1. 75 m (13200 plants ha-1) The double hedge planting will accommodate more number of plants per unit area. Early high yield, better soil conservation, less weed growth, efficient cultural practices and better supervision are other advantages of double hedge planting. In clayey soil and drought-prone areas, deeper pits (60 cm) or trench planting will be advanta- geous. Planting seasons Southwest monsoon areas: June-July Northeast monsoon areas: September- October Planting If the soil pH is more than 5. After planting the seedling, compact the soil surrounding the plant and apply mulch   25 t ha-1. Manuring Manuring of young tea commences two months after planting. Centering should be done 4-6 months after planting during humid weather when there is adequate moisture in the soil. Planting of silver oak The silver oak can be propagated through seeds. Use 6-9 month old seedlings for planting. Apply a mixture of 100 g rock phosphate and 400 g dolomite per pit and thoroughly mix with soil prior to planting. Thin out shade initially to 12 m x 6 m after 8-10 years of planting and if required further thinning may be done to 12 m x 12 m at later stages (12 years from planting). Temporary shade For frost prone areas: Acacia mearnsii For mid elevations: Indigofera teysmanii For higher altitude: Sesbania cinerescens, Crotalaria agathiflora and Acacia elata Planting at 3 m x 3 m spacing is adopted. (1) At the time of planting: 500 ml per pit. (2) Post-planting treatment: Loosen the soil around the bush and pour one litre per bush. Biocontrol agents Trichoderma or Gliocladium (200 g per pit) may be incorpo- rated at the time of planting. The predisposing factors for the disease are deep planting, planting in gravelly soils, mulching closer to collar, wounds caused by weeding implements, fertilizer application close to collar, pegging, low moisture status in bark and surface watering during dry weather. Season October-February Seeds and sowing Raised nursery beds of 1 m width and of convenient length should be prepared for raising seedlings. About 75 g seeds sown over an area of 100 m2 will give the required number of seedlings for planting one hectare. Main field planting Seedlings are transplanted on flat beds. The nursery is irrigated well a day before planting to facilitate easy pulling out of the seedlings.

Red sandy loam soil with good drainage is the most ideal for commercial cultivation of guava. Planting material Air layering is widely adopted for propagation of selected varieties. When the new flushes are produced, the plant can be hardened in full sunlight preparatory to transplanting in the field. Planting Pits of one metre cube are made 6 m apart. After planting, mulching with dry leaves should be done to conserve moisture. June-July is the ideal time for planting. Square system of planting facilitates easy orchard operations. Yield Guava layers start bearing from 3-4 years after planting. Cultivation Emblica is usually propagated by seeds and vegetatively by wedge grafting. It bears fruits in 3 years after planting and is extremely precocious in habit. Planting materials Use grafts for planting. Planting Prepare pits of size 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm at a spacing of 12-15 m. Deep planting results in poor growth of the graft. Harvesting The seedlings generally bear after eight years and the grafted plants after three years of planting. Preparation of land Dig pits of size 70 cm x 60 cm x 70 cm at a spacing of 7-8 m at least one month in advance of planting. Planting material Use budded plants for planting. The budded plants are ready for planting in 6-12 months. Time and method for planting Planting is done during July-August.

Prepare pits of size 1 m x 1 m x 1 m at a spacing of 9 m, one month before planting and allow to weather. Deep planting results in poor growth of the plant. After cultivation Base banding technique for Loranthus management: To manage the mistletoes in mangoes, base banding with a strip of cotton cloth (20cm long, 1cm width) soaked in 2  2,4-D on a fresh wound, either on the root system or lower most portion of the parasite stem will be effective. The occurrence of low temperature and frost limits its cultivation. In Kerala, the limiting factors for commercial cultivation are high rainfall and severe drought in summer. To raise seedlings for planting in a hectare, 250 g seeds are required. Papaya seedlings raised in polythene bags can stand transplanting better than that raised in seedbeds. Planting Two months old seedlings are transplanted in the main field in May-June at a spacing of 2 m x 2 m. Intercultivation and intercropping Keep the papaya plot free of weeds. When papaya is grown as the main crop, vegetables can be profitably cultivated as intercrop for about six months from planting of papaya seedlings. Harvesting The seedlings flower and set fruit within 3-5 months after transplanting. This treatment is given 15 days before sowing. Season The planting season is May-June. Planting should be avoided during the periods of heavy rains. KEW Kew is a variety recommended for large scale commercial cultivation in Kerala. The Package of Practices recommendations for its cultivation is detailed below. Preparation of the land Prepare the land for planting by ploughing or digging followed by levelling. Dip the cured suckers in 1per cent Bordeaux mixture at the time of planting. Planting Rake the soil and plant the suckers in double rows at spacing of 45 cm x 30 cm. Limit the depth of planting to 7. Adopt triangular method of planting in each trench so that the plants in two adjacent rows are not opposite to each other (plant population 40400   ha). Apply fertilizers at the following dosage: Dose N:P2O5:K2O Per plant per year (g) 8:4:8 Per hectare per year (kg) 320:160:320 Apply full dose of P2O5 at the time of planting. Nitrogen and K2O may be applied in four splits, during May-June (at planting), August-September, November and May-June (2nd year). MAURITIUS Mauritius is recommended for commercial cultivation for table purposes and distant marketing, due to its shorter duration, better fruit quality, keeping quality and transportability. Season Main season of planting is April-May and August-September, but can also be planted in all months except during heavy rain of June- July. The best time for planting is August. For getting maximum price and better keeping quality, the best planting time is April-May. During summer months, if there are no summer showers after planting, irrigation should be given three weeks after planting for proper establishment. Planting is done in paired rows of 45 cm distance between rows and 30 cm between suckers. Contour planting may be adopted in sloppy areas. Intercropping in coconut garden: Land preparation, spacing and planting are the same as described above. Intercropping in rubber plantations: System of planting is in paired rows at 45 cm x 30 cm. Cowpea, sunhemp or daincha can be sown in the interspaces and covered with soil soon PINEAPPLE 224 after planting the suckers. Planting After preliminary land preparations, planting is done in small pits of 10-15 cm depth at a spacing of 45 cm between rows and 30 cm between plants in the rows. Manuring Apply compost   FYM   25 t ha-1 at the time of planting. Full dose of P2O5 is applied at the time of planting. Nitrogen and K2O are applied as four equal split doses after planting. First dose may be applied at 40-50 days after planting and thereafter at 60-70 days intervals. Weed control Pre-emergence (within a few weeks after planting) spray of diuron   1 kg ha-1 in 600 litres of water can keep the field free of weeds for about four months. Flower induction For inducing uniform flowering, 25 ppm ethephon is applied on physiologically mature plants having 39-42 leaves (7-8 months after planting). Harvest over different months   seasons could be obtained by carefully phasing   planning the planting and growth regulator application. 05 per cent before planting, keeping pineapple fields weed free and control of mealy bugs by spraying  drenching with chlorpyrifos 0. Season The season of planting is May-June. Planting should be avoided during the periods of heavy rains. Planting Planting is done in pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm at a square spacing of 7-8 m. Grafted sapota begins to bear in the third year after planting. Planting materials West Indian cherry is usually raised from layers. Plants may be hardened in full sunlight prior to transplanting. Planting For planting, pits of size 0. After planting, mulching may be done with dry leaves to conserve mois- ture. July to December is considered to be the best time for planting. Irrigation once in four days during early stages of growth up to one year of planting and later on, once in 7-10 days is necessary. Preparation of land The planting distance in India varies from 7-10 m, depending upon the vigour of plant. Planting material Apples are ordinarily propagated by budding or grafting on seedlings of Crab apple, Yellow Newton or Golden Delicious. Time and method of planting Apples are planted in the ground free of weeds. Planting is done late in win- ter. Pruning Pruning and training are important in apple cultivation. Planting and after care Plants are propagated vegetatively by separating suckers from flowering plants as and when available and planted in the medium. Planting in pots is preferred in the plains. Cultivation in beds is good at higher altitudes (about 1000 m above MSL). Terminal cuttings with one or two healthy aerial roots are ideal as planting material. A plant with minimum two or three pseudobulbs with the basal root is ideal for planting. Planting Terminal cuttings of monopodial orchids are planted loosely on old coconut husks at a spacing of 30 cm between plants and 45 cm between rows in long beds. Planting is done above the medium with a support for proper anchorage. Planting can also be done in pots or other containers. Mud pots of 10-20 cm diameter with several large holes on the side and bottom, filled with tile bits, chopped coconut husk or charcoal are used for planting. Dipping in fresh cowdung solution before planting also gives good results. Jasminum sambac is the most ideal species for cultivation in Kerala. Well-drained sandy loams and red loams are ideal for its cultivation. Better rooting of cuttings can be obtained by planting in coarse sand and also by using any of the rooting hormones like IBA (5000 ppm), IAA (1000 ppm) and NAA (5000 ppm). Layers will be ready for planting within 90-120 days. Planting After ploughing the land, pits of about 40 cm x 40 cm x 40 cm size are taken and filled with topsoil and 15 kg well rotten FYM. Planting distance depends on the species as given in table below and also on soil and envi- ronmental conditions. Planting is usually done during June- August. 00 Species Planting distance J. 5 are the best for cultivation. Medium and large sized corms are preferred for planting, as small corms produce only small flower spikes. Planting The land is ploughed two or three times and FYM   25 t ha-1 is applied and mixed well with the soil. Top dress the crop with 50 kg N, 45 days after planting and earth up. Best season for planting is September- November. Harvesting and yield The plant starts flowering in 2-3 months after planting based on the variety. Soil Porous, well-drained sandy loam soils are best suited for tuberose cultivation. Seedlings are ready for transplanting when they Propagation Propagation is by bulbs. Boat shaped bulbs of size 2 to 3 cm are preferred for planting. 50 lakh bulbs (800 to 900 kg) are required for planting one hectare. Best time for planting is May-July. Of these, half N, full P2O5 and K2O are applied at the time of planting. Three or four ratoon crops can be taken from single planting. 3 kg N per ha each time, the first at 3 months after transplanting and the second TUBEROSE AND CROSSANDRA 236 8-9 months after transplanting.

It consists of removing terminal portion of the plant 30-45 days after transplanting. Harvest and yield Marigold flowers will be ready for harvest in about 21 2 months time from the date of transplanting. The seedbeds are irrigated immediately after sowing. The seedlings will be ready for transplanting in about four weeks. For transplanting, prepare the main field by ploughing land three or four times. The crop has to be top dressed with 50 kg N at 40 days of transplanting. Harvest and yield China aster blossoms will be ready for harvest within 10-12 weeks of transplanting. Take pits of size 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm at a spacing 2 m x 2 m at least one month prior to planting and allow to weather. Planting Nursery is raised and 4-5 months old seedlings are planted with the commencement of southwest monsoon. After planting, press the soil around the seedling and form mound to prevent stagnation of water. After cultivation During first year, cultivate the rows in both directions to prevent weed growth. Seed materials Whole or split rhizome with at least one healthy sprout is the planting material in kacholam. Two weeks before planting of the new crop, smoking the rhizomes by spreading it on Glycosmis pentaphylla (panal) leaves is practised in certain localities. Local types are also under cultivation. Season and method of planting Planting is done during the month of May with the receipt of pre-monsoon showers. Manuring Apply FYM or compost as basal dose   20 t ha-1, either by broadcasting and ploughing or by covering the rhizome in pits after planting. Mulching After planting, mulch the beds with dry or green leaves   15 t ha-1. After cultivation Remove weeds as and when necessary. Apply fertilizers and earth up the crop during the first and second weeding (45 and 90 days after planting). Harvesting and curing The crop can be harvested seven months after planting. The crop provides maximum yield from the second to fourth year of planting and economic yield up to the sixth year. Seeds and sowing The crop is propagated mostly through seeds. It can also be propagated vegetatively through planting of slips. Sugandhi is the improved variety of lemon- grass recommended for cultivation. The seedlings will be ready for transplanting in 2 to 2. Before planting, the top leafy portion of the seedling is cut off leaving the plant stalk about 15-20 cm length. After cultivation Regular weeding depending on weed growth and earthing up at least once in a year along with manuring is recommended. During the first year of planting, three cuttings are obtained and subsequently five to six cuttings per year are taken subject to weather conditions. The first harvest is taken about 90 days after planting and subsequent harvests at intervals of 40-50 days. So seedlings are preferred as planting materials under Kerala conditions. Planting Prepare the main field for planting, form beds and plant the seedling, two on a hill, at a spacing of 30 cm x 20 cm. Generally two cuttings are made during the first year of planting. Varieties Two types of vetiver namely, South Indian and North Indian (khus) are generally under cultivation. Planting The crop is propagated through slips. June- July is the optimum period for planting. Planting materials Propagated by single, double or three node semi-hard wood stem cuttings. Make ridges of about 30 cm height and 50 cm apart for planting rooted cuttings. Entire P2O5 has to be applied as basal dose and N and K2O in two split doses, 2 months and 4 months after planting. After cultivation Weeding has to be done two or three times depending on weed growth. For controlling nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita and Radopholus similis) associated with Chethikoduveli, apply Pseudomonas fluorescens   10g plant at the time of transplanting rooted cuttings. Harvesting The crop can be harvested in about 12-18 months after planting. VETIVER, CHETHIKODUVELI AND NEELA AMARI 244 CHENGAZHINIRKIZHANGU (Kaempferia rotunda) Seeds and sowing Seeds are very small and the seed rate is 3 kg ha-1.

Best time for planting is after the receipt of summer showers (May-June). Seed rate Stored pseudobulbils of previous year are used as planting material. Planting Bulbils are planted at a spacing of 10x10 cm. Beds are mulched heavily after planting with green or partially decomposed dry leaves. Powdered FYM leaf compost vermicompost is applied   100g m2, 60 days and 90 days after planting. After cultivation Carry out gap filling if any within 30 days. Crop flowers 1-2 months after planting. Harvesting and yield After six months of planting, aerial parts start yellowing. Well-drained hilly areas with an underlying hard pan is good for its cultivation. Seeds are cleaned, dried and stored for sowing. 5 month old seedlings are ready for transplanting. At present, only local varieties are available for cultivation. Planting Pits of 30 cm3 size are taken at a spacing of 60 cm x30 cm distance and filled with 10 kg dried cowdung and top soil and formed into a mound. Since the part used as drug and the propagule are one and the same, the mother bulbils are used as drug and the side bulbils can be used as planting material for next season. 2 month old seedlingsfrom the polybags are used for transplanting. Planting Square shaped pits of 60 cm depth are taken at 3 m spacing and filled with topsoil, sand and dried cow dung. After cultivation Carry out gap filling, if any, within one month; remove weeds two months after planting followed by top dressing, earthing up and mulching. Harvesting can be done one and half to two years after planting and it is better to harvest in January   February. Germination can be substantially increased by treating the seeds with hot water (500 C) for a period of six to twelve hours prior to sowing. Planting Seeds are sown in poly bags. After cultivation The basins of the trees are cleared of weeds and after application of manures and fertilizers covered with soil. After cultivation The base of the trees is to be cleared of weeds and FYM at 2 kg tree year may be applied twice; first in May-June and again in October-November. Seed materials 3-5 noded rooted cuttings are used for planting in the field. It recorded 800 to 850 kg dry spikes per hectare in open condition and 350 to 400 kg in coconut gardens during second year of planting. Season, method of planting and manuring In a well ploughed land, beds of 1m width and of convenient length may be taken and pits are taken at a spacing of 60 cm x 30 cm. Harvesting and curing Mature female spikes can be harvested seven months after planting. Well drained loamy soils are suitable for its cultivation. Cultivation Plough the field and pits of size 60 cm x 60 cm x 45 cm are taken at a distance of 4 m. Cultivation It can be grown in any type of soil but cannot tolerate waterlogging. The seeds are dipped in water for 12 hours before sowing in the nursery. Harvesting The harvesting can be done from 7-8 years after planting. There are 2 types of Koovalam, North Indian type and South Indian type, of which North Indian type is suitable for cultivation. The seeds will germinate within 15 - 20 days after planting and they are transplanted to poly bags at 5 - 6 leaf stage. 2 months old seedlings are used for field planting. Land preparation and planting Plough the field, and pits of size 60 cm x 60 cm x 45 cm are taken at a distance of 4 m. Well- drained loamy soils are best suited for cultivation. In sloppy areas pits can be taken for planting. FYM   10 t ha-1 is applied at the time of planting. The crop can be harvested 2 years after planting. Harvesting The leaves can be collected one year after planting. The roots are harvested two years after planting and it is better to harvest in December- January. Cultivation It is grown in well-drained soil and cannot tolerate waterlogging. The seeds are sown in nursery beds two months before planting. Since the seeds are very small, mix with sand   4 times the quantity of seeds for sowing and the seed rate is 500 g ha-1. The seeds germinate by 8   12 days and are ready for transplanting by 6 weeks after planting. Irrigate the crop in alternate days up to 2 weeks after planting. Earth up the field at 2 months after planting. Harvesting can be done 90 95 days after planting. The side suckers can be used as planting material. Propagation and planting Propagated by rooted cuttings. From second year onwards up to 10th year after planting the leaves can be harvested at regular intervals. Healthy disease free rhizomes with at least one germinated sprout is the planting material. The best time for planting Sida is before the onset of monsoon. The optimum stage for harvesting is five months after planting. Optimum stage of harvest is 8 months after planting. Kasthurimanjal is recommended for cultivation under intensive homestead system with Coconut   Arecanut   Pepper based intercropping situation. Under Kerala conditions, the best season of planting is with the onset of south west monsoon during May-June. As an irrigated crop planting can be done at any time of the year. Seeds and slips can be used as planting material. To obtain slips for planting, old clumps are uprooted and slips with roots are separated. For planting one hectare, 1. The grass requires thorough cultivation to prepare a weed-free seedbed for establishment. Mix with soil and cover the trenches and form ridges of 15 cm height for planting slips. At planting two irrigations are required within seven to ten days for quick establishment. Two intercultivations should be given during this period. Later, intercultivation may be necessary after three or four cuttings. The first cut is usually ready in 9-10 weeks after planting and subsequent cuts are taken at 45 to 60 days intervals. If irrigation facilities are available, planting can be done at any time between February and November. One or two weeding or intercultivation is given in the first 2 to 3 months. To control weeds and to encourage fresh sprouts, one or two intercultivation has to be carried out every year. Planting is done with the onset of southwest monsoon. The planting rate depends upon the spacing and the weight of the cuttings or rooted slips used. Early intercultivation once or twice is necessary before the plants establish and grow vigorously. Subsequently, intercultivation should be given as and when necessary. Planting can be done at any time other than The first cut is taken 9-10 weeks after planting. In order to save time and labour, the planting materials are scattered in the field and covered by ploughing crosswise during monsoon season. Seeds can also be used for direct sowing or sowing in nursery for transplantation. The requirement of slips for planting ranges from 27000 to 40000 per ha. First harvest is done about three months after planting when the grass attains a height of about 60 to 75 cm. Planting of seedlings can be done with the onset of rains in May-June or September- October. Sundry the seeds afterwards for about one hour before sowing. For sowing, a fine seedbed is required and seeds are broadcast at 1-2 cm depth. To protect the seeds from ants, dusting carbaryl 5 per cent DP at the time of sowing is effective. Intercultivation during early growth stages is advisable to check weed growth. The first harvest can be done 50 days after planting and subsequently at 30-40 days interval. Sowing is preferably done during February- March in a nursery or polythene bags or in situ at 2-3 cm depth. 2 m for planting in boundaries and borders of coconut gardens and 2 m x 0. The land should, however, be cleared of bushes, ploughed and levelled before sowing. Two or three inter-row cultivation is essential to check weeds in early life. Subabul starts flowering at 125-150 days after planting. A number of varieties like Karnataka local, RS-9, UPC-1956, UPC-5287 and UPC- 9805 are recommended for cultivation for fodder purpose. For seed crop, line sowing is preferred. A pre-sowing irrigation is important for the proper germination of the crop. As a fodder crop, the first cutting can be given 45 days after planting and subsequent two cuttings at 30 days intervals. In less fertile soils like sandy coastal soils, phosphorus fertilizer should also be added along with sowing of seeds so as to help the development of root nodules. Sowing is to be done with the onset of southwest monsoon during May-June. Irrigation is required if there is no proper soil moisture at the time of sowing. Seeds are soaked in water overnight and mixed with Rhizobium culture before sowing. The optimum season for sowing is the last week of June to second week of July and September to October. First cutting of maize can be taken after 60 days of planting or at the milky stage of the crop. The depth of sowing should be 5-10 mm. Gap filling may be done 15 days after sowing. First weeding is given 45 days after sowing. First harvest is taken 3-4 months after sowing and subsequent harvest at 45 days intervals or according to the growth of the crop. 271 STYLO AND FODDER MAIZE GREEN MANURE CROPS Sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) It is a vigorous growing green manure crop, which can be incorporated at 10 weeks after sowing. rostrata) Sesbania aculeata It is a quick growing succulent green manure crop, which can be incorporated at about 8 to 10 weeks after sowing. When kolingi is sown in an area for two or three seasons continuously, scattered seeds will give rise to volunteer plants and there is no need for further sowing. Within two years after planting, the plants are ready for lopping. Sowing is done after the bed is watered. Usually sowing is done by broadcast method (or dibbling) in Nov-December, for June planting and March-April, for October- November planting. After sowing, a thin layer of soil is sprinkled on the beds to cover the seeds. After sowing, watering is done with a fine rose-can twice a day for 10-15 days and once a day afterwards. Pricking out Germination takes place in about 8-10 days after planting and the seedlings attain a height of 10-15 cm in six weeks time. Planting practices Containerised stock (commonly in polybags, but also in root trainers) is planted in pits (15- 20 cm cube) at 2 m x 2 m spacing with the onset of rains, in the case of monospecific woodlots. Ailanthus is ideal for planting in the homestead or farm boundries either in single or staggered paired rows at a spacing of 2. After sowing the seeds, a thin layer of sand is sprinkled to cover the seeds. Usually sowing is done in Nov-December. Planting and stand management Casuarina has a wide environmental adaptability and hence occupies sites ranging from arid regions to coastal zones. Planting is done immediately after the first rain. Block planting, row planting and line or strip planting are common. The cultivation practices of these two species are described below. Planting stock Three-month-old containerized stock (polybag seedlings or root trainer seedlings) is recommended for planting. Germination begins 7-9 days after sowing. Planting stock of high yielding disease resistant clones are available at the KFRI   Kerala Forest Department nurseries. Planting and stand management Best time for planting is the beginning of rains. Planting is usually done in 20 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm pits (for clones use 30 cm cube pits) at 3 m x 3 m spacing. It tolerates varied site conditions and has adaptability to different planting objectives. It starts to flower and produces seeds 18-20 months after planting. Pre-sowing treatment and nursery practices To break dormancy of mangium seeds, hot water treatment is recommended. Seed inoculation with appropriate rhizobial strain is recommended before sowing. Mangium seedlings are ready for pricking out in 6-10 days after sowing. EUCALYPTUS AND MANGIUM 278 Planting and stand management Planting is usually done in pits of 20 cm depth and 10-12 cm diameter. The crops can be raised in one meter wide beds laid in between the planting rows of Mangium. First weeding must be carried out two months after planting and thereafter at regular intervals depending on weed growth. Silvicultural management schedule for mangium saw log regime Age Activity Remarks 4 months after planting General slashing Uproot all climbers within 45 cm radius of each plant. 6 months after planting General slashing As above 12 months after planting General slashing Remove all branches up to 1. and first pruning 2 years after planting First thinning and Remove 300 trees ha, retaining 600 trees per ha. 4-5 years after planting Second thinning Remove another 200 trees ha retaining 400 trees ha. 8-9 years after planting Final thinning Remove another 200 trees ha. Pre-sowing seed treatment 1. Sowing is done after the bed is watered. Usually the sowing is done by broadcast method or dibbling in April-May. After sowing, the seeds may be pressed into the beds. Stumps with 15-20 cm of root at 2-3 cm of stem prepared with sharp knife are commonly used for planting. Planting With the pre-monsoon showers, stump planting is done in crowbar holes during April- May (four to six weeks before the onset of regular monsoons). If containerized planting stock (polybags, root trainer) is used, then optimal time of planting may be after the onset of southwest monsoon in June-July. For one or two row strip plantings at farm boundaries, a closer plant-to-plant spacing of 1 m could be employed initially and later thinned to attain better size. Thinning For a fifty-year rotation, monospecific teak plantation on a good site (initial spacing 2 m x 2 m), thinning may be carried out at 4, 8, 12, 18, 26 and 36 years after planting. One year-old seedling can be used for planting. Planting should be carried out immediately before the rainy season. One week prior to planting, drench the nursery bed with 30 litres of carbendazim 0. It involves splitting   dividing the mass of rhizomes and planting out the culms in small clumps with two or three culms attached. Planting and fertilization Spacing recommended for mono-specific 283 THORNY BAMBOO ROSEWOOD (Dalbergia latifolia) Rose wood is an important timber yielding tree of South India. However, interspecific competition in bamboo-based agroforestry systems can be overcome by planting crop 8-9 m away from the bamboo clumps. WILD JACK OR AINI (Artocarpus hirsutus) Ideally suited for boundary planting and as scattered trees on the farm field. Artificial Propagation Propagation is possible both by direct sowing and by planting seedlings, root suckers and sections of lateral roots. Stump planting of nursery seedlings is favoured, particularly in the west coast. For direct sowing it is advisable to break the pods into one seeded parts. Soaking in cold water for 24 hours before sowing will result in 80 per cent germination. Instead of direct sowing, nursery raised seedling or stumps are also used to raise plantations. Through tissue culture, good planting materials can be produced which was proved by the research work carried at the Kerala Agricultural University, College of Forestry. Planting and stand management Saplings of rosewood can be planted in pits of 30 cm cube made at a spacing of 5 x 5 m. Soil beds of size 10 x 1m are used for sowing. Planting and management After a period of 8-10 months, seedlings of size of 20 cm tall, 5cm girth with 20-25 leaves with brownish stem and small branches are transferred to field. Both direct sowing or by transferring nursery raised seedlings to fields are practiced. In the case of direct sowing, shady and weed free localities are preferable. If nursery raised seedlings are used for planting, shady areas have to be preferred. After sowing, soil covering of thickness not more than 4 mm is given. Planting and management Seedlings of 14 to 16 months old plants are to be transferred to fields. Planting is done in pits of 45 cm cube with the onset of monsoon at a spacing of 4m x 4m filled with 5 kg FYM. Artificial propagation This is effected by direct sowing or by planting stumps and seedlings from nursery or seedlings from forest. Sun dried seeds are used for sowing in the field. Planting and management Planting in the field is done at a spacing of 4m x 4m. Direct sowing is found to be successful. planting materials in the main field. Planting and management Poly bagged seedlings are the best planting materials in the main field. Planting is done in pits of 35 cm cube filled with top soil and 10 kg of FYM. Pits are taken with the onset of monsoon and planting is done during June-July. Artificial propagation By direct sowing or by planting nursery raised seedlings. In the case of direct sowing, seeds are sown in lines keeping a distance of 12 cm between. Planting and management Planting is done in pits of 30 cm cube along with onset of monsoon at a distance of 5m x 5m. Seeds are collected from full grown trees and soaked in cold water for about 2-3 days before sowing. Planting and management Site preparation includes ploughing the land and making 30 cm cube pits before the onset of monsoon. Planting is done at a spacing of 4m x 4m along with south west monsoon. Artificial propagation is possible by direct sowing or by planting stumps or nursery raised seedlings in the field. Planting and management Planting and management practices are similar to that of venga. Artificial propagation Artificial propagation is by direct sowing or by planting nursery raised seedlings. Planting and management Planting is done mainly during the monsoon season. Pit planting is recommended at a spacing of 3m x 3m. Seawater ingress into Kuttanad is controlled through bunds and barrages to facilitate rice cultivation. Rice cultivation is made possible by dewatering (pumping out water from fields). Coconut is raised on uplands and a special kind of rice cultivation, locally known as Pokkali cultivation, is done in lowlands. Seawater ingress into these lands is controlled through barrages and weirs to facilitate rice cultivation. Cultivation is confined to limited areas of valley lands and around tribal hamlets. Rhizobium (Bradyrhizobium and Azorhizobium) It induces better root nodulation and stem nodulation in inoculated plants and thereby brings down the requirement of nitrogen fertilizer for the cultivation of pulses, oil seeds and legume green manures. Seedling root dip (for transplanted crops): Slurry of the culture is prepared by mixing 500 g culture with 50 ml of water and the roots are dipped in the slurry for 15 20 minutes before transplanting. 311 VERMICOMPOST AND COIRPITH COMPOST AND BIOFERTILIZERS Inoculation for paddy: Mix 2 kg of culture in 60 litres of water and soak the seeds required for 1 ha (60 kg) for 24 hours before sowing. At the time of transplanting, dip the roots of seedlings for 15-20 minutes in the culture slurry prepared by mixing 2 kg inoculum with 40 litres of water. Blue green algae (BGA) Mainly recommended for wetland rice cultivation. Method of application Broadcasting in the rice fields at the rate of 10 kg ha-1 one week after transplanting. Azolla It is suitable for wetland rice cultivation. The inoculation can be done by placing inoculum (3-5 g sett) beneath the sett before planting. 5 litres of water) for 20 minutes, prior to transplanting. This can be done at the time of sowing, transplanting or during intercultivation. Since a floating population of azolla can release its bound nutrients only during decay in the soil, it is essential to incorporate azolla in the soil prior to the transplanting of rice seedlings. In areas where split application of nitrogen is not feasible due to water stagnation after planting sowing, full dose of nitrogen as basal may be given in the form of neem coated or coal tar coated urea. Deep placement of prilled urea or super granules during the last ploughing followed by flooding and planting is beneficial in light soils. Since phosphorus requirement of seasonal crops is confined to the early stages, phosphatic fertilizers are to be applied at the time of seeding or planting. Windbreaks may be provided by planting shrubs, flowering plants and also creepers like antigonon. Method of planting and spacing (a) Pit system (rainfed crop): Spacing 75 cm x 75 cm (pit size 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm). Planting material The variety K2 gives higher yield and better quality leaves. Planting For irrigated crop, two cuttings should be planted at each spot along the margin of the ridge. Maintenance of the garden (1st year) After 8 months of planting, 50 kg each of N, P2O5 and K2O should be applied per ha after weeding. First harvest can be taken six months after planting by leaf picking. The damage starts at the time of planting and continues up to harvest. 5kg ha-1) one week after transplanting   Foliar spray (10g l-1) after one month is effective for the management of sheath blight of rice under upland condition. For transplanted crop, root dip treatment at the time of transplanting, followed by a spray 30 days after transplanting can be recom- mended. For black pepper, drenching the nursery plants immediately after planting followed by one or two sprays depending on the extent of disease. After the period of solarization, remove the sheet and the bed is ready for sowing and transplanting. After solarization, the soil can be used for sowing planting. The land used for planting is initially prepared to a fine tilth and pebbles removed. Solarization and planting can then be done as already described. 336 MUSHROOM CULTIVATION MUSHROOM CULTIVATION Species of Pleurotus, commonly known as oyster mushrooms, grow saprophytically under natural conditions on trees, dead wood, stumps and branches. The tropical climate prevalent in the state is ideal for mushroom cultivation. Method of cultivation Polythene bags or tubes of 30 cm x 60 cm size and 150-200 gauge thickness are taken for filling the substrate. After 15 days when the spawn 337 MUSHROOM CULTIVATION running is complete, remove the polythene bag by cutting it with blade and keep the bed for sporocarp formation.

Rogue diseased plants, weeds and off-types in time. Spray 2 per cent malathion solution in the godown before storing seeds to check insect pests. Place pieces of cloth dipped in neem oil between stacked bags or neem oil cake covered in cloth bags inside seed bags to ward- off pests. Treatment with Carbendazim will protect the seedlings from blast disease up to 30 to 60 days after sowing. Note: Rice seedlings from solarised nursery beds show high initial growth, early maturity and resistance to leaf blast disease. Pruning of the top portion and root is not recommended as it inflicts wounds through which disease causing organisms may subsequently enter. Strict surveillance of pests and diseases is a must under such situations. Pests and Diseases Adopt control measures only if the pest   disease population exceeds the economic threshold levels which are given in Table 8. A general guide for rice pest control is given as Table 10. Pests Rice stem borer (Scirpophaga incertulas) Symptoms In the vegetative phase, the central shoot dies off turning yellow in colour (dead heart). In areas where stem borer occurs as a serious pest in all seasons, apply any one of the following insecticides first 15-20 days after transplantation and then at the boot leaf stage keeping minimum water level: Cartap hydrochloride, Quinal- phos, Carbosulfan, Fipronil, Chlorantra- niliprole, Flubendiamide, Indoxacarb, Malathion or Spinosad.

Adopt integrated pest management against insect pests and diseases. Closely observe the nursery for pest and disease attack and adopt control measures, if required. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in rice The indiscriminate use of pesticides for pest control has led to disturbances in natural ecosystem leading to resurgence of pests, secondary pests outbreak, toxic hazards and residues besides environmental pollution. This has led to major emphasis on Integrated Pest Management and gained greater momentum. Integrated Pest Management programmes promote favourable, ecological, economic and sociological outcome, which is accomplished by the best mix of pest control tactics. The use of appropriate scouting tactics, proper diagnosis of pest, the use of economic thresholds and conservation of naturally occurring biocontrol agents are fundamental components of a sound Integrated Pest Management programme. The important components in the IPM are the use of tolerant  resistant varieties, regulating planting density, adjusting the time of planting   sowing, group farming practices, cultural management of pests, integrated nutrient management, removal of weeds, use of botanical pesticides and preservation of natural enemies. A list of common natural enemies of rice pests is given as Table 12. For the preservation of natural enemies, collect the egg masses of pests in perforated polythene bags and keep them in the field so that the parasites that emerge can establish in the field effectively. The trichocard have to be cut into small pieces (minimum 10 pieces) and released in main field, 6-8 releases is necessary to control the pest. Precaution : If larval attack is observed in the field, necessary organic inorganic insecticides have to be used and a gap of 7 days has to be given before next release. Common natural enemies of insect pests found in rice ecosystem Female lays 200-800 eggs in life-time of 3-4 months. It consumes 5-15 insect pests in a day depending up on the size. Description of biocontrol agents Characters Pest attacked A. Adults fly normally below the rice canopy in search of flying insects. Stem borers, hoppers and other flying insects. Plant hopper and other small soft-bodied insects. Rice hoppers, moth and larvae that fall on the water surface Ground beetle Hard bodied insects. ) which play a vital role in managing a variety of insect and non-insect pests. Installation of bird perches   50 ha-1 increases the activity of insectivorous birds and reduces the pest population in rice fields. Effective and eco-friendly pest manage- ment in wet land rice ecosystem 1. Pest and natural enemy population should be monitored for deciding spraying schedule. Spot application of insecticide may be adopted in heavily infested pockets to control further spread of the pest and to conserve the existing natural enemy population in rice ecosystem. Dark coloured tiny insects. Insecticidal control is not needed for mild to moderate levels of infesta- tion. Variety T-9 is moderately tolerant to drought condition; CO-2 is photoinsensitive but susceptible to pests and diseases. Plant protection IPM package against major pests of cowpea 1. Soil drenching with Bordeaux mixture 1 per cent wherever fungal diseases are prevalent. Monitoring the field for incidence of pests  population of natural enemies especially at flowering stage (for Aphis craccivora, epilachna beetles and pod borers) and at pod formation stage for pod bugs. Adoption of mechanical methods of pest control such as application of ash at 10 DAS, keeping yellow sticky trap  yellow pan tray, collection and destruction of infested leaves, flower buds and pods and sweeping and destruction of the pests. For protecting cowpea seeds against pests under storage conditions, smear the seeds with groundnut or coconut oil at 1. Spray 1per cent Bordeaux mixture in early stages to protect the crop from fungal diseases. The disease appears in patches and become severe during dry periods. Plant protection Pod borer is the main pest. Plant protection The crop is free from infestation of major pests. The minor pests include stem fly (Melanagromyza sp. 51 RED GRAM AND SOYBEAN Collar rot The diseases include collar rot (Rhizoctonia solani) which causes water soaked lesions at the collar region which later spread along the whole stem. The disease occurs in patches under high soil moisture and high organic matter levels. To control the disease, provide good drainage (Refer cowpea). To control the disease, select seeds from disease free plots (Refer cowpea). Mosaic disease The spread of mosaic disease, characte- rized by mottling, curling and distortion of leaves and malformations of the pod is checked by rouging out the infected plant and spraying dimethoate 0. 05 per cent to control the insect vectors. Crop rotations, destruction of diseased plants and prophylactic foliar application of mancozeb 0. 3 per cent are recommended to control the disease. Use of disease free planting materials can avoid the incidence of this problem. Varieties H-97: This is a semi-branching variety, tolerant to mosaic disease with duration of 10 months. It is tolerant to mosaic but susceptible to wilt disease. It shows high tolerance to mosaic and low susceptibility to pests like red mites, scale insects, thrips etc. It shows high tolerance to mosaic and low susceptibility to pests like red mites, scale insects, thrips etc. Select mature healthy stems free from diseases or pests. 05 per cent) on the stem will control scale insects. Minisett planting technique for quality planting material For producing minisetts, mature, disease free stems preferably those obtained from indexed meristem culture should be selected. Mosaic virus infected plants, if any found, should be rogued off as soon as such symptoms are expressed, to keep the nursery disease free. Application rate of Mg and Zn based on their status in the soil Plant protection Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) The disease is transmitted by a white fly Bemisia sp. As a rule, only stem cuttings from disease free plants should be used for planting to minimize the spread of the virus disease. For this purpose, tagging of disease free healthy plants for selection as planting materials must be practised from September to December. Production of disease free planting material of tapioca through nursery techniques Setts of 3 to 4 node cuttings from apparently disease free plants are collected and planted in the nursery at a very close spacing of 4 x 4 cm so that about 500 setts can be accommodated in one square metre land. Screening for disease symptoms and roguing of infested plants may be continued in field at weekly intervals upto harvest. Bacterial blight Bacterial blight is a disease noted in severe proportion in certain parts of Kerala. Among improved varieties, H-97, H-226, H-1687 and H-2304 are tolerant to the disease while H-165 is highly susceptible. are tolerant to the disease. Red spider mites and scale insects Red spider mites in the field and scale insects under storage are important pests of tapioca. Management of storage pests of cassava Treating chips with granular salt (3 per cent), sun drying thoroughly and storing in gunny bags in godown are very effective against Araecerus fasciculatus and Sitophilus oryzae. To control this disease, spraying   drenching Bordeaux mixture (1per cent) is effective. Spray recommended insecticides for controlling the infestation of sucking insects as and when required. Pest and diseases Tea mosquito bug This is the most serious pest affecting cashew. The pest usually appears with the emergence of new flushes and panicle. A rational rotation of insecticides would be de- sirable to counteract the tendency of the pest to develop field resistance. Cashew stem and root borer (CSRB) This is a serious pest, which is capable of destroying the cashew tree. In the case of already infested trees, mechanically remove various stages of pest (grubs and pupae) by carefully chiseling the bark. 2 per cent   10 ml 1-1) and drench the pesticide solution onto the soil near the root zone to minimize reinfestation by the pest. Pest stages occurring in the roots should be destroyed so as to reduce pest inoculum in the future. Dieback or pink disease This disease is prevalent in cashew plantations during rainy season. For low volume application, the concen- tration of the insecticides is to be maintained at 0. 003 per cent Lambda cyhalothrin as a prophylaxis against pest infestation in nursery plants. Spray Bordeaux mixture 1 per cent to seedlings as a prophylactic measure against fungal diseases. Plant Protection Against sucking pests like jassids, aphids and thrips, spray imidacloprid (100 ml ha-1) on 20th day and 40th day. For bacterial blight disease, use strepto- cycline (50 g ha-1   copper oxychloride RUBBER (Hevea brasiliensis) Rubber can be cultivated from sea level up to an altitude of 500 m. Monoclonal plantations in general are prone to the outbreak of epidemics and RRII 105 is prone to Corynespora leaf disease as manifested in the Karnataka region during the year 2000. RRII 105 is highly susceptible to Corynespora leaf disease. PB 217 and RRII 203 are also susceptible to the disease and require prophylactic protection. Plant protection by regular spraying of fungicides and insecticides will be necessary to prevent disease insect pest damage. Reduction in disease incidence and increased growth is observed in poly houses. Prophylactic protection against diseases is recommended for the cultivation of all these clones. Partial shading (50  shade) during dry season reduces incidence of leaf spot diseases and sun scorch besides regulating transpiration loss. Well cured coir pith (washing with water at least for two months to leach out all toxic compounds) mixed with neem cake, bone meal, pesticides and single super phosphate is used as potting medium. 37 ) at 10-15 days interval is necessary to prevent incidence of panel diseases. Corynespora leaf spot disease (Corynespora cassiicola) Symptom The disease is prevalent in nurseries (Nov- May) and mature plantations (Jan-May). Pink disease (Corticium salmonicolor) Symptom Trees in the age group 3-12 years are highly susceptible. Management In high disease prone areas, the highly susceptible clones can be treated as a prophylactic measure with Bordeaux mixture or Bordeaux paste. Other diseases are patch canker, dry rot, Colletotrichum leaf spot disease, bird s eyespot, shoot rot, brown rot etc. Pests The pests associated with rubber are scale insect, mealy bug, termite, cockchafer grub, mite, snail, rat etc. Appropriate control measures may be adopted after identifying the pest. Varieties CoTI 1358 (Abhay): Tolerant to water logging CoTI 1153 (Aromal): Suitable for flood prone situations and have high sugar content suitable for jaggery production CO TI 88322 (Madhuri): Resistant to red rot disease Co 92175: Suitable for drought prone situation Co 740: For ratooning Co 6907, Co 7405 and Cul 57 84 (Thiru- madhuram): Red rot resistant, high sugar content Cul 527 85 (Madhurima): Resistant to red rot, tolerant to drought and waterlogging Co 88017 (Madhumathi): Resistant to red rot, tolerant to drought and waterlogging Preparation of land Plough the land thrice length-wise and breadth-wise and level properly. Selection of setts Select top ends of mature, healthy disease free canes up to 1 3 of total length and cut into setts of three eye buds. Seed treatment For control of fungus disease like red rot, dip cut ends of setts in 0. At this time, de-trashing is to be done to prevent the possible germination of axillary buds and to reduce pest infestation. Plant protection Pests The important pests of sugarcane found in the state are early shoot borers, top shoot SUGARCANE 94 borers, mealy bugs, white grubs, termites and rats. Management Use pest free setts for planting. Diseases Red rot The most characteristic symptom of the disease is the drying up of the canes, which when split open will show characteristic red colouration of the internal tissues with horizontal white patches and the typical foul smell. The disease is mainly transmitted through infected setts and flowing water and can be checked only by prophylactic means which are given below: 1. Affected crop should be harvested as early as possible to prevent loss in yield and deterioration in quality and also to arrest further spread of the disease. Water should not be let into a healthy crop from diseased areas and as far as possible, the field may be kept free of standing water by providing drainage channels. Seed setts should not be collected from diseased crops and from diseased areas. Movement of seed materials from diseased to healthy areas should be strictly quarantined. To control the fungal diseases, in general, dip the cut ends of setts in copper oxychloride 2 g l-1 solution before planting. Other transmissible diseases like grassy shoot, ratoon stunting etc. Attack of insect pests 3. Plant protection Pests Rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) Symptoms The adult beetle bores into the unopened fronds and spathes. Release Baculovirus oryctes infected adults   10-15 ha-1 to bring down the pest population. When the pest infestation is through the crown, clean the crown and slowly pour the insecticidal suspension. Incorporate any of the insecticide to each trap to kill the weevils trapped. Note: Application of the insecticides should be followed by liberation of larval and pupal parasites from the 21st day. Note: The insecticide may be applied according to the severity of infection in a need-based manner. Rational rotation of the above pesticides may be adopted to avoid chances of resistance. Apply non-residual phosphatic insecticide dimethoate 0. Diseases Phytophthora diseases Phytophthora palmivora has been found to affect seedlings and adult palms causing bud rot and immature nut fall commonly known as mahali. The disease proves fatal if not checked at the early stages, before damage of the bud. In early stages of the disease (when the heartleaf starts withering) cut and remove all affected tissues of the crown. Burn all disease-affected tissues removed from the palm. 0 per cent Bordeaux mixture on spindle leaves and crown of disease affected as well as neighbouring palms, as a prophylactic measure. Mahali Symptoms Shedding of female flowers and immature nuts are the common symptoms of the disease. Root (wilt) disease Symptoms The characteristic symptom is the flaccidity of leaflets. Yellowing of older leaves, necrosis of leaflets and deterioration and decay of root system are other salient features of the disease. Management Coconut root (wilt) is a non-lethal debilitating disease and the affected palms survive for a long period giving a reasonably good yield. The root (wilt) affected palms are susceptible to diseases like leaf rot and pests like rhinoceros beetle and red palm weevil. So there is a chance of confusing the pests and disease symptom with the root (wilt) disease. Efficient management of palms suspected to be affected by coconut root (wilt) disease demands control of all pests and diseases and imparting natural resistance and health to the palms through proper manuring and agronomic practices. A package of management practices for the effective management of root (wilt) disease is given below: 1. Rogue out palms that are affected severely by root (wilt) and yield less than 10 nuts   palm   year and those, which have contracted the disease before flowering. Replant with disease tolerant material   high yielding hybrids (Chandrasankara). The cheapest source of MgO is magnesite (MgCO3). Follow strictly all the prescribed prophylactic measures against leaf rot 109 COCONUT disease, red palm weevil, rhinoceros beetle etc. This disease is a fungal complex initiated predominantly by Colletotrichum gloeospo- rioides, Exserohilum rostratum and Fusarium spp. Treat the top two leaf axils with insecticide preparation. The lesions spread upwards as the disease progresses. The progress of the disease is faster during July to November. Grey blight This is caused by the fungus Pestalotia palmarum. Tanjore wilt Symptoms This disease is of recent occurrence in many parts of Kerala, especially in the districts of Palakkad, Malappuram, Thrissur, Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram and Wayanad. The characteristic symptom of the disease is the rotting of the basal portion of the stem. Safe storage of copra Copra obtained from commonly cultivated varieties   cultivars is attacked by various insect pests in store. Plant protection Red hairy caterpillar, termites and leaf min- ers are the major pests of groundnut. Against leaf miner apply any of the organophosphorus insecticides with contact action. Tikka leaf spot disease infects both the rainfed and irrigated crops. 0 per cent before flowering will control the disease. Leaf pruning Dead and diseased leaves and all inflorescences should be cut off regularly upto three years after planting. Plant protection Pests Rhinoceros beetle The pest causes severe damage to emerging fronds and spindle. Field sanitation and elimination of breeding sites are essential components of the pest management operation. This pest can be suppressed by using the virus Baculovirus oryctes. Red palm weevil This is a major pest of oil palm in India. Diseases Anthracnose This disease occurs in the nursery. The disease can be controlled by spraying mancozeb or captan   200 g 100-1 litres of water. As the disease advances, new leaves become rudimentary and show rotting. Roguing of all the affected palms may be adopted to prevent further spread of the disease. In early stages of the disease, the affected portions of leaves may be removed and burnt. Sesame varieties Kayamkulam-1 Suitable for lowlands of Onattukara Kayamkulam-2 Suitable for rice fallows in Onattukara, resistant to leaf (Thilothama) spot disease. For control of leaf curl disease, remove and destroy disease affected sesame plants as well as the diseased collateral hosts like chilli, tomato and zinnia. ISSR Vijetha is resistant to Katte disease and is recommended to moderate rainfall with moderate to high shaded mosaic (cardamom mosaic virus) infected areas. However, in Kerala where viral diseases is a serious problem seed propagation is not popular among farmers. Uproot a part of the high yielding disease free mother clump identified in the plantation. Care should be taken to identify and collect mother clumps only from areas totally free from  katte  disease. This will help to prevent the spread of diseases and expose the panicles to easy visit by honeybees. Control of pests and diseases in the plantation Cardamom thrips (Sciothrips cardamomi) This insect is a serious pest of cardamom. Since the pest population is high during dry months from December to May, pesticide application during this period is important. Four sprayings of insecticide during this period is recommended. Insecticide application can be skipped during rainy months of June and July. Any of the following insecticides are recommended for thrips control. Pest infestation is pronounced in three seasons viz. Insecticides sprayed at this time may not give adequate control of the pest. For an effective management of the pest, the insecticides have to be targeted on early stages of the larvae, which are usually present within 15-20 days after adult emergence in the field. For controlling the leaf caterpillars, mechanical collection and destruction and spraying of any contact insecticide are recommended. 121 CARDAMOM Cardamom whitefly  Kanakarajiella (Dialeurodes) cardamomi  It is a serious pest in cardamom growing tracts of Kerala. The adult is a small soft bodied insect, about 2 mm long and having two pairs of white wings. ) This scale insect is found on the lower surface of leaves, leaf sheath, panicles and fruit stalk. The pest is mostly seen during summer months. Diseases Katte or mosaic This is a virus disease, which is transmitted by the banana aphid, Pentalonia nigro- nervosa. CARDAMOM 122 Management Eradication of the source of inoculum by destroying infected plants and destruction of the vector by insecticide application are effective. Regular application of insecticide against cardamom thrips controls the aphids also. Destruction of plants showing symptoms of the disease should be done promptly once in two months. Azhukal This is a fungal disease caused by Phytophthora sp. Spray the shoots with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture with adhesive (rosin soda or any other sticker) by the commencement of the monsoon and continue the spraying operation two or three times up to November- December according to the intensity of the disease and rainfall. Give spray to the panicle with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture during July-August when the disease intensity is maximum. 1  Fosetyl  Al (3-5 l  plant) and repeat this at monthly interval depending the intensity of the disease and rainfall. Prophylactic application of the biocontrol agent Pseudomonas fluorescens (two percent spray) along with basal application of Mycorrhiza (100 g) and Trichoderma viride (50 g) per plant by the commencement of the monsoon and continue the spraying operation monthly depending on the intensity of the disease and rainfall. Trichoderma can be used along with cowdung for controlling this disease. Clump rot or rhizome rot This disease is caused by Pythium aphanidermatum, P. Stem rot or stem lodging This disease is caused by a fungus (Fusarium oysporum). The disease occurs during non rainy seasons. 1per cent checks the disease spread. Leaf blotch disease The fungus Phaeodactylium venkate- sanum causes this disease. The disease is characterized by the appearance of large blotches of irregular lesions with alternating shades of light and dark brown necrotic tissues. Management The fungicides, Bordeaux mixture (1 per cent), mancozeb (3 g l-1) and carbendazim (1 g l-1) are effective in controlling the disease. Chenthal disease Chenthal disease is characterized by the appearance of rectangular linear reddish brown lesions mainly on the lower surface of the leaves. The incidence of the disease appears to be more severe in areas, which do not have proper shade. Management Providing adequate shade is the only measure recommended pending confirmation of etiology of the disease. Waiting period of insecticide   fungicide Quinalphos 30 days Mancozeb 30 days Vegetative propagation For raising cinnamon from cuttings; semi hardwood cuttings of about 10 cm length with 2 leaves are taken and dipped in IBA 2000 ppm and planted either in polythene bags filled with sand or a mixture of sand and coirdust in the ratio 1:1 or in sand beds raised in a shaded place. Plant protection Leaf spot and dieback disease (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) On young nursery seedlings, small brown specks appear which gradually enlarge resulting in drying of the leaf. Spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture during rainy season controls the disease. The other diseases of cinnamon include grey blight caused by Pestalotiopsis palmarum, sooty mould caused by Phragmocapnius sp. Cut and remove dead and diseased branches of fully grown trees to prevent over crowding. Plant protection Pests Infestation of shoot borer Sinoxylon sp. Diseases Leaf spot, twig blight and flower bud shedding (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) Three types of symptoms are seen viz. 5 month intervals reduces disease intensity, defoliation and flower bud shedding. Destruction of the weed Clerodendron from the clove garden is recommended to reduce the disease since the pathogen survives on this weed during adverse conditions. The other diseases of clove are: Grey blight of clove (Pestalotia palmarum), Leaf spot of clove (Cylindrocladium quinqueseptatum), Leaf spot of clove (Alternaria citri), Sooty mould of clove (Phragmocapnius sp. Plant protection The occurrence of a wilt disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum has been observed. For control of wilt disease adopt the following measures. Remove diseased plants along with surrounding soil where the disease is observed. Fungal diseases like shoot tip rot, stem and bean rot caused by Phytophthora sp. The disease affected portions are to be removed regularly and 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture should be applied on the affected plants. For selection and preservation of seeds, adopt the following methods: Mark healthy and disease free plants in the field when the crop is 6-8 months old and still green. Select best rhizomes free from pest and disease from the marked plants. Drench the beds with PGPR GRB 35 (Bacillus amyloliquifacians) for growth promotion and suppression of soft rot disease. Select seed rhizomes from disease free areas. For controlling the leaf spot disease, 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture, 0. It is useful in biliousness, itching, skin diseases, bronchitis, asthma, hiccough and inflammation due to injuries. Seed material and varieties Whole or split mother rhizomes or well developed, healthy and disease free finger rhizomes weighing 15-20 g are suitable for planting. Plant protection Compared to the related crops ginger and turmeric, the crop is free from pests and diseases. To reduce the pest population, pull out the dead hearts with the larvae inside and burn it. The plant tolerates a minimum temperature of 10oC and maximum of 40oC, Pests The hard scale Saissetia nigra occurs on the pencil thick branches and desaps the tissues. Diseases Leaf spot and die back (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) Sunken spots surrounded by a yellow halo are the initial symptoms. The disease can be NUTMEG AND BLACK PEPPER 136 controlled by spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture two or three times during rainy season. Premature splitting of the pericarp and rotting of mace and seed are the main symptoms of the disease. The disease can be controlled by spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture. Other diseases: Phytophthora leaf fall, white thread blight, horse hair blight, sooty mould and algal leaf spot. Select mother plants, which give regularly high yields and possess other desirable attributes such as vigorous growth, maximum number of spikes per unit area, long spikes, close setting of berries, disease tolerance etc. Solarized potting mixture supplemented with nutrient solution (urea, superphosphate, MOP and magnesium sulphate in 4:3:2:1 ratio) and fortified with biocontrol consortia promotes growth and helps in production of disease free rooted cuttings. It reduces the incidence of soil born diseases and aids easy transportation of seedlings. of Enterobacter per vine which helps in growth promotion and disease suppression. Plant protection Pests For the control of pollu caused by the flea beetle Longitarsus nigripennis, spray any one of the following insecticides namely, dimethoate or quinalphos at 0. Three different types of scale insects are found infesting black pepper in high ranges of Idukki district. This scale insect can be controlled by spraying quinalphos 0. Adequate precaution has to be taken to ensure that the insecticide solution reaches the root zone of the vines. Two sprays of Azadiractin 5000 ppm at 15 days interval after the incidence of scale insect. 013  two sprays at an interval of 15 days after incidence of scale insect is also recommended. Diseases Phytophthora (Foot rot) For controlling the disease, adopt the following management practices: Phytosanitation All infected or dead vines along the root system are to be removed and burnt. To avoid soil splash and consequent disease initiation and spread, a legume cover in the plantation should be ensured. All chemical control measures are prophylactic in nature and application of chemicals in advanced stages of disease will not be effective in combating the disease. Foliar spray of carbendazim   1g l-1 or a formulation containing combination of carbendazim   mancozeb   1g l-1 during the month of June can effectively control the disease. Wherever Phytophthora foot rot management is undertaken properly, separate control measures for pollu disease may not be necessary. The cheapest and most effective sticker is rosin washing soda mixture. Rotting disease For control of rotting disease of cuttings in the nursery, VAM and Trichoderma can be applied in the potting mixture. Stunted disease The symptoms due to this disease include shortening of internode and narrowing of leaves with mottling. Since the disease is systemic and 143 BLACK PEPPER transmitted through planting materials, avoid collecting planting materials from such vines. Waiting period of insecticide   fungicide Dimethoate 20 days Quinalphos 20 days Mancozeb 30 days Harvesting and processing Black pepper Black pepper of commerce is produced from whole, unripe but fully mature berries. Select well developed, healthy and disease free rhizomes. Plant protection No major incidence of pest or disease is noticed in the crop. Leaf folding pests common in the nursery can be controlled by spraying with quinalphos   2 ml 149 CAMBOGE l -1 at monthly intervals. Pests and diseases Hard scales and beetles are found to infest the crop. Control these pests by spraying dimethoate   1 ml l -1. Pests and diseases Insects like Tribolium castaneum and fungi are serious problems in storage and field respectively. Plant protection Pests Mites Orange coloured mites can be controlled by spraying the bunches with dimethoate at 0. Repeat application for 2 or 3 years consecutively to secure a complete eradication of the pest. 153 ARECANUT Diseases Koleroga (Mahali or fruit rot) (Phytophthora palmivora) Spray Bordeaux mixture 1 per cent on all bunches three times in a year, one just before the onset of southwest monsoon and the rest at 40 days intervals. Yellow leaf disease Together with the routine pest and disease control measures different management strategies may be adopted to control yellowing of arecanut grown in the following topo sequences: 1. Band disease Improve soil conditions by loosening hard soil strata, if present, by providing good drainage. Drench spindle and base of seedlings with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture in disease affected nursery or garden. Aureofungin sol at 100 ppm concentration is also effective in controlling the disease. Stem bleeding Palms in the age group of 10-15 years are more prone to this disease. With the progress of the disease, a brown exudate oozes out from these cracks. High water table predisposes the palm to this disease. 5 per cent) is suggested as control measure against this disease. Nut splitting This can be considered as a physiological disorder than a disease. Hyper nutrition or sudden flush of water after a period of drought or insufficient moisture in the soil is the probable cause (s) of the disease. Improvement of drainage in ill drained gardens and spraying of borax   2 g l-1 of water are found effective in reducing the disease incidence. Plant protection The insect pests include the mirid bug (Disphincuts politus) which desaps the tender leaves and shoots, scale insects and mealy bugs (Lepidosaphes and Pseudococcus), which occur on the stems. Insecticidal application is not recommended to avoid toxic hazards. 05 per cent quinalphos against the scale insects and mealy bugs. Against scale insects, restrict insecticide application on the stem only. The leaves should be harvested only after 15 days of insecticide application. Among the diseases, the bacterial leaf spot caused by Xanthomonas betlicola is most serious in southern Kerala. The cultivars Karilanchi, Karpuram and Thulasi are found susce- ptible to the disease. Spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture is recommended to control the disease. These are also tolerant  moderately resistant to vascular streak dieback disease. Scions for budding are to be collected from high yielding, disease resistant elite plants. Patch budding as described earlier may be done on three to four vigorous and healthy shoots using scions from high yielding, disease resistant clones and the remaining chupons are removed. Plant protection Pests Red borer (Zeuzera coffeae) Larvae burrow into the main stem of young plants and fan shoots of older trees, causing drying up. COCOA 162 Rats (Rattus rattus) Rats are serious pests in densely planted coconut gardens with cocoa as an intercrop. The pest can be controlled by spraying quinalphos 0. Diseases Seedling blight (Phytophthora palmivora) The symptoms develop on the leaves and stem of the seedlings or budded plants. 163 COCOA Lasiodiplodia pod rot   charcoal pod rot (Lasiodiplodia theobromae) The disease occurs more frequently during dry season. Management Since the disease is more common on pods of plants under stress, better management practices will reduce the incidence of the disease. Colletotrichum pod rot (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) The disease causes rotting of immature pods. Management If the disease is detected early, remove and destroy the affected tissues completely and apply Bordeaux paste. Since canker mainly develops from pod rot caused by Phytophthora, proper control measures of Phytophthora pod rot will help in reducing incidence of the disease. Pink disease (Corticium salmonicolor) The disease appears as a pinkish powdery coating on the stem of affected plants. The disease mainly affects the forking region and the damage is localized. Repeat spraying again once or twice during the monsoon season according to the intensity of the disease. COCOA 164 Vascular Streak Dieback (VSD) (Oncobasidium theobromae) The first indication of the disease is the characteristic chlorosis of one or two leaves on the second or third leaf behind the tip. The chlorotic patches on the diseased leaves develop into small sharply defined green spots scattered over a yellow background. Diseased leaves fall within a few days after turning yellow. Leaves above and below the first diseased leaf soon begin to show yellowing with green patches and these also fall off finally resulting in dieback of the infected branches. These fruiting bodies have been found only on leaf scars and adjacent bark in the diseased region of cocoa stems. If the diseased stem is split longitudinally, the xylem is found to be discoloured by brown streaks. The humidity should not exceed 80 per cent so as to prevent mould development and pest incidence in the beans. Before storing cocoa, the store can be made clean and insect free by application of pesticides well in advance, but pesticides should neither be applied nor be kept with the beans inside the store. Generally robustas are tolerant to leaf rust disease and resistant to White Stem Borer pest, which are more on record in arabica. Planting materials Old arabica varieties like Kents and Coorgs are more susceptible to the leaf rust disease (Hemileia vastatrix). Arabica selections of tall, medium and dwarf habit are grown on large scale because of their proven performance in yield and comparatively better resistance to leaf rust disease. Adequate protection is given against nursery diseases and pests. Planting in field Disease free and vigorous seedlings are selected for planting. Urea RP MOP Urea RP MOP Urea RP MOP 16  30  incidence of pests   diseases, pattern of blossom showers etc. Diseases Leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix) This is an important disease causing economic loss particularly in arabica coffee. Black rot (Koleroga noxia) A disease more in occurrence in endemic areas with heavy rainfall, saturated atmos- phere with 95-100 per cent RH, thick overhead shade, low over-hanging branches, sheltered from sunlight and wind in valleys or continuous 173 COFFEE mist during monsoon. If disease is noticed, remove and destroy the affected leaves and berries along with strands of mycelia to prevent further spread. Pests Coffee berry borer (Hypothenemus hampei) Coffee berry borer is the most serious pest of coffee world over. A typical pinhole at the tip of the berries indicates the presence of the pest and it damages young as well as ripe berries. Timely and complete harvest, collection of gleanings, burying the infested berries and maintaining optimum shade and good drainage can control the pest. for mass trapping are more effective in containing the pest. Although a number of pesticides have been tried against this pest, only a few are effective. Pesticides should be used with extreme caution and only if no other option is available. (Aug-Sept for Arabica and Sept-Oct for robusta) can control the pest. Shot hole borer (Xylosandrus compactus) This is a major pest in robusta coffee affecting the secondary and tertiary branches causing considerable damage. The pest prefers to breed in the suckers during dry period. Green scale (Coccus viridis) The green scale is a serious sucking pest of coffee particularly arabica. Management The chemical control measures include spraying the affected patches with any one of the following insecticides viz. Field preparation In the case of new planting, in order to avoid the incidence of root diseases, after felling the trees, remove the root system to the extent possible. The pest is a serious problem in areas where un-decomposed farm- yard manure is used. ) The pest is a problem in the nursery. Alternate host of the pest is coffee and cocoa. Large hepialid borer (Sahyadrassus malabaricus) This is a polyphagous pest attacking teak, eucalyptus and lantana. Thick branches (3 cm diameter) are preferred by the pest. They are dry weather pests mostly attacking mature foliage except pink and yellow mites. Thrips (Scirtothrips bispinosus) This is a major pest in all tea growing coun- tries. Management Phosalone, quinalphos and dimethoate can be used for the pest control. Root diseases Black root disease (Rosellinia arcuata) Common in areas, which were previously under jungles. Other root diseases are red root disease (Poria hypolateritia), brown root disease (Fomes noxius), root splitting disease (Armillaria mellea) and xylaria root disease (Xylaria sp. Stem diseases Collar canker (Phomopsis theae) Seen mostly on young tea. The predisposing factors for the disease are deep planting, planting in gravelly soils, mulching closer to collar, wounds caused by weeding implements, fertilizer application close to collar, pegging, low moisture status in bark and surface watering during dry weather. Other stem diseases are branch canker (Macrophoma theicola),woodrot (Hypo-xylon serpens) and dieback (Leptothyrium theae). TEA 180 Leaf disease Blister blight (Exobasidium vexans) The fungus affects only tender leaves and stems (pluckable shoots). Management Copper oxychloride 350 g   plantamycin 70 g per ha at 3 to 4 days interval can control the disease.

Banana rhizome weevil The attack by this pest is reported to be serious in all localities where banana is cultivated. Aphid Act as vector for the transmission of the dreadful bunchy top disease in banana. Diseases Bunchy top disease This is a virus disease transmitted by aphids. Eradicate disease affected plants. Use disease free suckers for planting. Dip suckers of susceptible varieties in 2 g l -1 carbendazim solution to prevent spread of the disease. Drench the soil around affected clumps with 2 g l -1 carbendazim solution to prevent spread of disease. Varieties such as Palayankodan, Robusta and Nendran are resistant to the disease. Spray 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture with sticker soon after the appearance of the initial symptoms of the disease. The disease appears with the commencement of southwest monsoon. Five to six sprayings at fortnightly intervals are to be given depending upon the severity of the disease. Petroleum based mineral oil 1 per cent emulsion is also effective in controlling the disease. Spray carbendazim 1 g l-1 or give alternate sprays of mancozeb (2 g l-1) and carbendazim (1 g l-1) soon after the appearance of initial symptoms of the disease. Three to four sprays at fortnightly intervals are to be given depending on the severity of disease. Kokkan disease (Banana bract mosaic virus) Kokkan disease was found to affect other varieties like Palayankodan, Kodappanilla- kunnan, Monthan, Kanchikela, Poovan (Rasthali), Karpooravally, Chenkadali and Nendran. Necrotic streaks are another important symptom of the disease. The abnormal colour and reduction in the size of bunch depend upon the severity of the disease. 213 BANANA Infectious chlorosis (Cucumber mosaic virus disease) The disease is noticed in varieties such as Nendran, Palayankodan, Karpooravally, Kosthabontha, Peykunnan, Bhimkhel, Mottapoovan, Dakshinsagar, Madhuraga, Rasthali and Musa ornata. As the disease progresses, leaves emerge distorted, margins become irregularly wavy, often with blotches of necrotic tissues and the lamina is reduced in width. This is a virus disease transmitted by aphids. Use disease free suckers for planting. Eradicate disease affected plants. Avoid growing leguminous and cucurbi- taceous vegetables as intercrop in banana in disease prone areas. Banana streak disease Banana streak disease is caused by Banana streak badna virus and transmitted by pineapple mealy bug (Dysmicoccus brevipes Cockerell) and striped mealy bug (Ferrisia virgata Cockerell). For the control of the disease, eradicate diseased plants, do not select planting materials from infected clumps. Plant protection Fruit rot disease This is a serious disease of guava especially during rainy season. Remove such trees as soon as the symptoms are identified to prevent the spread of the disease. Fruit fly This is a serious pest of guava. The insect affects the fruit when it matures. No serious pests or diseases are generally found in this crop.

For the management of the disease, preventive methods like, destruction of diseased plants, treating suckers by dipping in chlorpyrifos 0. Scale insects (Diaspus bromeliae): Spraying of chemicals for the control of mealy bugs, mentioned above, will be sufficient for the control of scale insects. Pruning consists of removal of dried and diseased wood and also the drooping branches. During the second dormant pruning, the crowded, misplaced or diseased secondary branches are removed and the extra vigorous ones headed back. They produce aerial roots, which absorb water and nutrients from Plant protection Diseases The two major diseases are bacterial blight and anthracnose. 15 per cent at weekly interval from the initiation of the disease is effective for the management of bacterial blight of anthurium. 05 per cent can control the disease. Pests The major pests are scales and bugs, which are controlled by spraying malathion   2 ml per litre of water. Plant protection Diseases The important fungal diseases are leaf spot, leaf blight, collar blotch, collar rot and orchid wilt. Important virus diseases are mosaic and ring spot. Destroying the affected plants can control spread of these diseases. Pests The common pests attacking orchids are thrips, aphids, spider mite, soft scale, mealy bugs, orchid weevil, ants etc. Other very serious pests of orchids are snails and slugs. All the pests can be controlled by application of contact and systemic insecticides at appropriate concentration. Diseases Leaf blight: Can be controlled by spraying 0. Brown and Fusarium wilts are the major diseases. 05 per cent is recommended when diseases are noticed. Plant protection Slugs and grass hoppers, which feed on the leaves and thrips which damage and cause dis- tortion of the spikes are the major pests. Malathion is effective against these pests. No major disease is noticed. Plant protection Scales, plant bugs and white flies are the important insect pests, which can be controlled by phosalone (0. The incidence of the disease is found to be more in the presence of root lesion nematode. Plant protection Marigold is not attacked by many pests. These plants are rarely attacked by diseases. Rhizomes are used to protect the clothing against insects and are chewed with betel nut. Select well developed healthy and disease free rhizomes. Plant protection During heavy rains, leaf rot disease occurs in certain localities. For controlling this disease, drench the beds with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture or thiram 0. Prolonged storage can cause insect and fungus attack. Serious pests or diseases do not generally infest the crop. This is an esteemed remedy for leucoderma and other skin diseases. Pests The psyllid Arytaina puctipennis infest top shoot causing curling up and drooping of leaves and shoots and wilting of plants. The rhizome is an odoriferous ingredient of the cosmetics used for the cure of chronic skin diseases caused by impure blood. Prolonged storage may cause insect and fungus attack. Seed rate A healthy disease free mother rhizome with at least one germinated sprout is the planting material. Plant protection No serious pests and diseases are encountered in the crop. Seed rate Fresh healthy disease-free rhizome bits with at least one shoot is the planting material, which is required   1000-1500 kg ha-1. Plant protection Usually pests and diseases are not serious enough to take up any control measures. Blight disease can be controlled by spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture. It improves complexion and is useful in general debility, deafness, cough, asthma, piles, skin diseases, impotency, jaundice, urinary disorders etc. Seed rate Fresh healthy disease free rhizome with at least one shoot is the planting material, which is required at 750 kg ha-1. It is also useful in eye diseases and it imparts resistance to diseases. Plant protection No serious pests or diseases are generally noted in this crop. Plant protection No serious pests or diseases are generally noted in this crop. Fruits as well as roots of the plant are attributed with numerous medicinal properties and are used for diseases of respiratory tract, carminative and as a general tonic for maintaining health, vigour and vitality. The bark gives bitter tonic and is an astringent and is useful for fevers and skin diseases. It is also having insecticidal property. Healthy disease free rhizomes with at least one germinated sprout is the planting material. It is very effective medicine for the dreadful skin disease psoriasis. Two-three nodded healthy disease free vine cuttings are planted at a spacing of 20 cm x10 cm in the field. The beds are also mulched with green leaves to reduce the evaporation losses and dusted with carbaryl 10 per cent to prevent insect attack. Pests Nursery: The two major pests are shoot webber (Alteva fabriciella) and defoliator (Eligma narcissus). Young plantations: The above two are the major pests in young plantations also, but control measures may not be cost effective. Usually control measures are not adopted but any insecticide, which is recommended under the nursery, can be used. Stem wilt or bark blister disease caused by Trichosporium vesiculosum is a serious disease in the plantations. The disease affects trees of 3-4 years and causes mortality up to 80 per cent. Planting stock of high yielding disease resistant clones are available at the KFRI   Kerala Forest Department nurseries. 8 and treating the plantation with fungicidal sprays can control this disease. Other diseases include stem canker and dieback caused by Phomopsis casuarinae, pink disease caused by Corticium salmonicolor, root rot disease caused by Ganoderma lucidum and heart rot caused by Polyporus glomeratus, Fomes fastuosus and F. Insect pest problems to the tune of regular epidemic infestations inflicting extensive economic losses rarely occur in casuarina. Store the seeds under dry and insect rodent-free conditions. Injuries and protection Polyphagous insects seem to attack the nursery stock. Cylindrocladium leaf blight and pink diseases are common in eucalyptus trees. Bordeaux paste is recommended against pink disease. Use disease tolerant clones for, preventing the incidence of both diseases. Injuries and protection Although root rot disease caused by Ganoderma sp. Signs of the disease are evident on the roots after the tree has fallen or upon excavation. Depending on, which fungus causes the disease, there may be dark reddish granular rusty brown encrustation or white thread-like rhizomorphs on the surface of the rots. The usual method of controlling root rot caused by fungi that spread by root contact is to remove and destroy all diseased roots and woody debris. Chemical protection against pink disease (Corticium salmonicolor), especially in Table 33. The best way to prevent pink disease, however, is to plant tolerant varieties. Although about 30 insect species are reported to be pests of mangium, only a few such as root feeders, branch and stem borers and the red coffee borer are considered economically important. The only effective method to control red coffee borer (Zeuzera coffeae) damage is to inject insecticide into the holes where larvae push out their frass. The bed is then dusted with carbaryl 10 per cent to prevent insect attack. Pests, diseases and their control White grubs feed on roots in the nursery. Vascular wilt disease (Burkholderia solanacearum) is noticed in nursery and young plantations. As preventive measures against this disease, maintain proper drainage and avoid root injury. Leaf spot disease (Phomopsis sp. Against pink disease (Corticium salmonicolor) in young plants, apply Bordeaux paste. However, only in small plantations   woodlots chemical control through insecticide spray is advocated. Pests and diseases The bamboo plantations in Kerala do not face any serious insect problems. In bamboo nurseries, damping off caused by Rhizoctonia solani is a major disease. Seedlings are naturally seen in shrubby diseases. Damping off disease by Phytophthora is also common particularly in nursery which can be controlled by drenching Bordeaux mixture 1 per cent. Pests of Coccidae and Membracidae family also attack these plants. Plant protection Sandal spike disease is a serious problem. In affected plants, growth of leaves gets stunted (assumes a spike like form and hence the name  spike disease ) and later premature leaf fall occurs. However, removal of affected plant parts or plants as a whole from the field is recommended against spike disease. Spike disease is transferred by pests like Jassidus indicus, Moono albimaculata etc. It is also found to be effective in skin diseases. Termite and pest infections are rare, so it used in manufacture of furniture, railway sleeper, buildings etc. is found to be more effective than using pesticides, fungicides etc. Suitable for rearing Lac insect. Fungal diseases can be controlled by spraying carbendazim 0. Plant protection Fungi like Botryodiplodia theobromae and Coletotrichum gloeosporioides produce leaf spot disease. The vermi wash, either alone or in combination with botanical pesticides can be used for pest management in kitchen gardens. They are social insects living in colonies. Absconding Absconding is the total desertion of colony from its nest due to incidence of disease   pest attack, too much interference by human beings or robbing of honey by bees from other colonies. Diseases: The dead larvae due to Thai sac brood virus (TSBV) in the comb cells may be removed and destroyed. Location of beehives Follow the practices as in Indian bees, but use a strong four-legged stand well protected from ants and other crawling insects by providing ant wells. Stagnant water or water in a container is not appropriate because it can spread nosema disease. Pests and diseases Brood mite (Tropilaelaps clareae): Infests the brood and the infestation is severe during the major brood rearing season (October- January). Locating and destroying their nests by burning or insecticidal usage is an effective control measure. The apiary should 323 BEEKEEPING be kept clean and the ant nests destroyed by insecticidal applications. These birds are also very useful in keeping down the insect population in a locality and hence no large-scale measures against them can be recommended. Thai sac brood virus Symptoms All the larval instars are susceptible to the disease, earlier instars being more susceptible. Presence of unsealed cells in brood area containing diseased larvae with their head directed outwards like the prow of a boat. Management Being a virus disease there is no known remedy. Pests Tussock caterpillars (Euproctis fraterna) Larvae eat the leaves of the mulberry plant. Mealy bugs (Maconelliococcus hirsutus) It causes  tukra disease. Scale insect When attack is severe, branches dry and become yellow. Root knot disease (Meloidogyne incognita) Common in sandy loam type of soil under irrigated conditions. Diseases Powdery mildew (Phyllactina corylea) It is more common during November- February. Leaf spot (Cercospora moricola) Diseased leaves have a number of circular or irregular brownish black spots of varying size. Rearing house of approximately 20 m 2 for 100 dfls (disease free layings), with good ventilation, mild temperature (24-28ºC) and humidity (65-85 per cent). Rearing techniques Disinfect the rearing house and equipments two-three days before rearing to prevent silkworm disease. Diseases Pebrine It is the most destructive disease of silk worms and is caused by protozoa, Nosema bombyscis. aggravates the disease. 327 SERICULTURE AND RODENTS AND THEIR CONTROL RODENTS AND THEIR CONTROL Rats are important non-insect pests and can be grouped into two different groups as domestic rats and field rats. They also act as carriers of several human and animal diseases. Use only disease free layings from authorized agencies. Pests Uzi-fly (Trycholyga bombycis) It is a serious parasite of silkworm larvae and pupae causing heavy loss. Other pests include ants, lizards, rats, squirrels, dermestid beetles and birds. Integrated control of field rats Rats cause considerable damage to agricultural practices and other human possessions in addition to acting as carriers of several human and animal diseases. Diseases like bubonic plague and weils disease (due to contamination of food by the urine of rats) are caused by rats. Pseudomonas fluorescens (Ad hoc recommendation) Pseudomonas fluorescens are a group of bacteria very effective against disease incited by species of Phytophthora, Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, Colletotrichum, Ralstonia and Xanthomonas in various crop plants in the nursery as well as in the main field. Isolates of Pseudomonas fluorescens have been developed by the Kerala Agricultural University for the disease management and growth promotion of crop plants. The application may be repeated based on the intensity of the disease incidence. For black pepper, drenching the nursery plants immediately after planting followed by one or two sprays depending on the extent of disease. This method is found to be very effective to raise disease free pepper cuttings. Main field Solarization can also be effectively used for the control of soil borne diseases in the main field. Biopesticides and fertilizers can be incorporated in soil after removing the polythene sheet. It is an inter-stock hybrid of Pleurotus petaloides with firm flesh, pure white colour and is resistant to pest and diseases. Management of Pests and contaminants of Oyster mushrooms in Kerala   Maintain the pH of the water used to soak the substrate at 8. Remove insects trapped on the sticky surface everyday. Disease free planting materials can be made available to the farmers. Wash the harvested produce in plain water or in chlorinated water to clean it of the adhering mud, dirt and residual pesticides. Temperature and humidity build up inside the green house can be controlled by natural ventilation through insect proof nets (40-50 mesh) and by providing the required height to the structure. Ventilators should be provided with insect proof net. Insect and other pest attack is limited to thrips and mites for which suitable control measures should be adopted. The sides can be kept open to ensure ample ventilation or can be provided with insect proof netting or shade net. The other advantages are less distortion of Roof ventilator provided with insect proof net side ventilator provided with insect proof net UV stabilized polyethylene sheet (200 micron) 12.

Apply compost or cattle manure at the rate of 1 kg m2 of the nursery bed and mix well with the soil at the time of preparation of the field. It would be better to transplant 10-15 days after incorporating organic manure. Before transplanting or sowing, apply manures and fertilizers at the rates specified for the region and varieties as indicated in Table 4. Apply fertilizers on the drained soil at the time of final ploughing and levelling and thoroughly mix into the soil.

But both organic and inorganic manures are applied and incorporated. Manuring Organic manuring Apply organic manure in the form of farmyard manure or compost or green leaf   5 t ha-1 and incorporate into the soil while ploughing. The entire quantity of phosphatic fertilizers may be applied along with the organic manures. Use of biofertilizers is recommended (See chapter on biofertilizers). 5 kg ha seed along with rice to serve as a source of green manure. When the rice field gets submerged with the onset of south west monsoon, cowpea at the age of about six weeks and at active vegetative stage decays and gets self-incorporated in the soil adding substantial quantity of green manure. Wet seeded rice In wet seeded rice, daincha can be raised as an intercrop by sowing 20 kg seed of daincha ha-1 along with rice (seed rate 60 kg ha-1) to serve as a source of green manure. 0 kg ha-1 at 30 days after sowing thereby adding substantial quantity of green manure. Fertilizer application The rates of N, P2O5 and K2O recommended as fertilizers are given in Table 4 and stages of application in Table 6.

In coarse sandy loam soils with high percolation as in Onattukara region, nitrogen and potash fertilizers may be applied in five equal splits at planting, 15th, 38th, 53rd and 70th day for medium duration varieties which coincide with the stages of early tillering, neck node differentiation, early reduction division and heading stages respectively in the case of medium duration varieties. In sequential cropping of rice, application of 50 per cent of the nutrient requirement (on nitrogen equivalent basis) as organics (FYM, rice straw, green manure) and 50 per cent as fertilizers during kharif season and the entire dose of nutrients as fertilizers in rabi season enhances the grain and straw yield. Application of 25 per cent of the nutrient requirement as organics and 75 per cent as fertilizers during kharif season and reducing the fertilizer dose of rabi by 25 per cent gives comparable yield with full POP recommendation during both seasons. Specific dose of fertilizer for Koottumundakan system A fertilizer dose of N:P2O5:K2O 20:10:10 kg ha-1 for the first crop and 30:15:15 kg ha-1 for the second crop is recommended for high yield in Koottumundakan system. The fertilizer for second crop may be applied as a single dose immediately after the harvest of the first crop (ad hoc recommendation). Fertilizers (N:P2O5:K2O)   40:20:20 kg ha-1 for virippu and 20:10:10 kg ha-1 for the photosensitive mundakan crop are recommended as economic dose for the northern region under Koottumundakan practice. Methods of fertilizer application For pre-planting application, apply the fertilizers at the final ploughing. In areas where availability of water is assured, temporarily draining the field one day prior to application and re-flooding after twelve hours is recommended for top dressing of fertilizer. Oil seed cakes such as punna and neem cakes can also be mixed with urea (1 part of oil cake   5 parts of urea by weight) for increasing fertilizer use efficiency. In Kari soils of Kuttanad, apply Dolomite   450Kg ha as two splits, half at the time of initial ploughing and half as top dressing one week prior to the application of fertilizers at the PI stage. Split application of water-soluble phosphatic fertilizers in two equal splits as basal and at maximum tillering stage is effective in giving higher grain and straw yield than the full dose as basal dressing under certain situations. A time lag of one week should be given between application of lime and fertilizers. For top dressing, lime may be applied one week prior to the application of fertilizers. Feeding adversely affects absorption of water and nutrients. 33 RICE a) Apply neem cake-coated urea as recommended under fertilizer appli- cation. Grow a green manure crop like daincha in April-May in areas where the virippu crop is usually transplanted. This will help to reduce the cost of weed control and also the loss of water and nutrients through percolation. Under good management practices (vide item 1-6) reduce the dose of fertilizer N to half the present recommended level. Apply the fertilizer when the plant is able D. Adopt agronomic practices for increasing fertilizer use efficiency such as: (a) Incorporating ammoniacal N in the reduced zone in the soil (b) Incubating urea with moist soil (1:6) for 24 hours (c) Blending urea with neem cake. Choose fertilizer materials, which are cheaper, e. Apply phosphatic and potash fertilizers once in two seasons in areas where there is no marked response for these nutrients. The important components in the IPM are the use of tolerant  resistant varieties, regulating planting density, adjusting the time of planting   sowing, group farming practices, cultural management of pests, integrated nutrient management, removal of weeds, use of botanical pesticides and preservation of natural enemies. The left over paddy straw on decomposition generate abundant food material in addition to the duck manure flowing down from the nursery pond.

The Rhizobium culture or the inoculated seeds should not be mixed with chemical fertilizers. The lime-pelleted seeds can be mixed with the fertilizer and sown. However, the period of contact between fertilizer and the pelleted seeds should be as short as possible. For vegetable cowpea, fertilizers can be applied in several split doses at fortnightly intervals. Manuring Lime 500 kg ha-1 Cattle manure 3000 kg ha-1 N 40 kg ha-1 P2O5 80 kg ha-1 After cultivation Weeding and intercultivation once in three weeks will ensure a good crop. Manuring Apply fertilizers to provide N:P2O5:K2O   20:30:10 kg ha-1. The fertilizers may be applied basally. In soils of low fertility, application of organic manures is beneficial. Apply second dose of fertilizers (N and K2O   50:75 kg ha-1) one month after the first application along with intercultivation and earthing up. Organic farming technology for elephant foot yam Recommendation   Raising green manure cowpea (seed rate   20 kg ha-1) prior to elephant foot yam and incorporation of green matter at 45-60 days. Inter-sowing of green manure cowpea (seed rate   20 kg ha-1 ) between elephant foot yam pits and incorporation of green matter in pits at 45-60 days. The green matter addition from the 2 green manure crops should be 20-25 t ha-1. Manuring Soil amendment (dolomite), cattle manure and NPK  1 ton ha-1, 25 tons ha-1 and 80:50:150 kg ha-1 respectively is recommended for cultivation. Apply cattle manure and P as basal. To meet the remaining 75  Nitrogen sow green manure cowpea in the interspaces   20 kg ha-1 immediately after planting tannia and incorporate at 45-60 days. Application of N bio-fertilizer   10 g per plant within one month of planting and application of neem cake in pits after one month of the bio-fertilizer application has to be done. In some areas, earthing up three times along with weeding and fertilizer application is recommended. When crop is grown in kitchen garden without applying any fertilizer, weeding is done especially at the early stage of plant growth. Manuring Apply cattle manure or compost   12 t ha-1 as basal dressing, while preparing the ridges for planting. A nutrient dose of 80:25:100 kg of N:P2O5:K2O ha-1 is recommended. Organic Farming of Taro Application of FYM   15 t ha-1 in pits at the time of planting (400 g plant -1), application of neem cake  1 t ha-1 in pits at the time of planting (30 g plant-1), application of biofertilizers Azospirillum   3 kg ha -1, mycorrhiza   5 kg ha -1 and phospho bacteria   3 kg ha-1, inter- sowing of green manure cowpea (seed rate   20 kg ha-1) between yam mounds and incorporation of green matter at 45-60 days.

Manuring Apply cattle manure or compost   10 t ha-1 at the time of preparation of ridges. The top dressing of fertilizers may be done along with the second after cultivation. Under rainfed conditions, green manure crops such as kozhinjil and sunnhemp can be grown after harvest of the sweet potato and later incorporated into the soil at the time of land preparation for the succeeding crop. After the basal application of recommended manure in the main field, ridges of 30 cm height are taken with a spacing of 45 cm between the ridges and planting is done on the ridges at a spacing of 45 cm. Manuring Cattle manure or compost may be applied at 12. 5 t ha-1 during the preparation of land or while filling up the pits so as to provide about 1 kg of organic manure per plant. Dose of P2O5 can be reduced to half where the crop is grown for more than 3 years under full dose of recommended fertilizers, since under such situation there would be build up of soil P. 5 kg ha-1 (1g plant-1) in small channels around the mounds within 2 months of planting cassava providing an interval of 2 weeks between the application of these fertilizer enhances tuber yield and quality. Initial training and pruning of cashew plants facilitate easy cultural operations such as terrace making, weeding, fertilizer application, nut collection and plant protection. Manuring A fertilizer dose of 750 g N, 325 g P2O5 and 750 g K2O per plant is recommended for cashew. Broadcast the fertilizer within an area of 0. Cattle manure and 4 kg of rock phosphate for every 100 m2 of nursery bed is recommended as basal dressing. Zinc sulphate   25kg ha may be applied 2 weeks after the fertilizer application. After 6   8 weeks from first fertilizer application, urea may be applied   275 kg ha. Monthly application of the fertilizer 10:10:4:1. Compost or well- rotted cattle manure   12 kg and rock phosphate 200 g are mixed with the top 20 cm soil in the pit. When small pits are taken, the manure should be incorporated around the plant basin leaving around 15 cm from bud union. Manures and fertilizers should be applied separately to rubber and intercrops as per requirement of the crop. For perennial intercrops, the dose of chemical fertilizers can be reduced to 50 per cent after 5 years. The fertilizer application to intercrops will affect soil nutrient status. Hence after intercropping, fertilizer application for rubber should be done based on soil testing to avoid nutrient imbalances. Manuring The general fertilizer recommendations for rubber plantation of the traditional are provided in Table 21. However, these are subject to modifications for individual holdings based on soil and leaf nutrient status, soil type, age of the plantation, management practices followed, etc. Application of compost farm yard manure enhances growth of rubber and adds to fertility of soil. As zinc deficiency is commonly noticed especially in young rubber, zinc sulphate application   25 kg ha or 50g plant mixed with equal quantity of farm yard manure or top soil (for uniform distribution) two weeks after the post monsoon fertilizer application during the year of planting is advocated as an ad hoc recommendation. Time and frequency of fertilizer application Fertilizer should be applied when there is sufficient moisture in the soil. In the year of planting, fertilizer application is done 2-3 months after planting ie. From second year onwards, the fertilizers should be applied in two equal splits during April-May (pre-monsoon) and September-October (post-monsoon) when there is enough moisture in the soil. For manure rubber also, fertilizers can be applied in two equal splits, first application after a period of about 30 days after the onset of pre-monsoon showers after ensuring the presence of prolific feeder roots in the surface soil and second application during September-October. Method of application During the first year, fertilizers should be evenly distributed over a circular band of 30 cm all around the base of young plant, leaving about 7 cm from the base and slightly forked into the top 5 to 8 cm of soil.

Discriminatory fertilizer recommendation Fertilizer recommendation based on soil and leaf analysis ensures site-specific fertilizer application for rubber and is the most ideal approach. Manuring Apply compost or cattle manure, 10 t ha-1 or pressmud 5 t ha-1 or dolomite 500 kg ha-1 or calcium carbonate 750 kg ha-1. In addition, the following fertilizers as N:P2O5:K2O kg ha-1 are also recommended. 5 (Madhuri, Thirumadhuram, Madhurima and Madhumathi ) Chittoor area : 225:75:75 Newly cleared forest areas: 115:75:90 Apply organic manures such as compost  cattle manure pressmud as basal dose preferably in furrows and mix well with soil before planting. The crop should be weeded twice on 45 and 90 days after planting before application of fertilizers. Manure the crop by 25th and 75th days after harvest of the previous crop. Manuring young palms For the first three years after planting under rainfed conditions, apply fertilizers in two split doses at the rates shown in Table 23. Fertilizer requirement of adult palms is given in Table 24. Fertilizer requirement of young palms in relation to that of adult palms Time after planting Time of application April-June Sept-Oct. 6 m to 9 m 170-120 Single hedge 5 m in the rows 9 m between the rows 220 Double hedge 5 m x 5 m in rows 9 m between pairs of rows 280 Note: Under irrigated conditions, the fertilizers can be applied in 3-4 equal split doses. In the case of low lying areas, apply fertilizer after water table recedes in one single dose or in two split doses as conditions permit. Soil moisture is essential for the absorption of nutrients by roots. Fertilizer recommendation for coconut Quantity (kg palm annum) N P2O5 K2O 1. Green manure and cover crops Green manure and cover crops recom- mended for cultivation in coconut gardens are: a. Green manure crops: Crotalaria juncea (sunhemp), Tephrosia purpurea (kolinji), Indigofera hirsuta, Pueraria phaseoloides b. Shade-cum-green manure shrub: Tephrosia candida Sow cowpea seeds more towards the periphery of basins taken at a radius of 2. 0m from the base of the palm for green manure during April-May with the onset of pre- monsoon rains. Sow green manure and cover crop seeds during April-May with the onset of pre- monsoon rains. The green manure crops should be ploughed in and incorporated into the soil during August-September. Calapagonium can be grown either as green manure or cover crop. Tephrosia is especially suited for planting around seedling pits for summer shade and as a source of green manure in the rainy season. Manuring of adult palms The nutrient dosages recommended for adult palms are given in Table 24. Under irrigated conditions, fertilizers can be applied in 3-4 equal split doses. In the case of low-lying areas, apply fertilizers in one single dose after water table recedes or in two split doses as conditions permit. The application of organic materials such as forest leaves, cattle manure, coir dust or coconut shredding at 10 kg per pit in the first three years and 15-25 kg thereafter will be useful to obtain better establishment of coconut palms in sandy soils and in coastal situations. In situations where the available P2O5 status of the soil is more than 10 ppm, application of phosphatic fertilizers can be skipped for a few years until the status of P2O5 reaches 10 ppm. Time, frequency and method of fertilizer application Under rainfed conditions, apply fertilizers in two split doses, 1 3 at the time of early southwest monsoon showers in April-June and 2 3 in September-October. Under irrigated conditions, apply fertilizers in three or four equal doses in April-May, August-September, December and February- March. Apply fertilizers and manures in circular basins at a radius of 2. Recycling of palm waste Recycling of palm waste is very much beneficial especially for maintaining the availability status of micronutrients and trace elements. It ensures better land utilization, solar energy harvesting, efficient water use, utilization of soil nutrient resources, more returns and an insurance against crop failure. In all cases, separate application of adequate fertilizers and manures to the individual crop is essential. Some of the major advantages of drip irrigation are: it saves water, enhances plant growth and yield, saves energy and labour, most suited for soils having low water holding capacity and undulating terrain, reduces weed growth and improves efficiency of fertilizers. Incorporation of Clerodendron infortunatum   10 per cent w w basis in the cowdung pit and or manure pits. Improving nutrient status by applying organic manure at the rate of 50 kg and neem cake 5 kg per palm per year. Also apply the recommended dose of fertilizers in two split applications. Apply fertilizers for coconut palms in average management at the rate of 0. For palms under good management, fertilizers may be given   of 0. In addition to the above, apply 50 kg cattle manure or green manure and 1 kg of lime palm year. Growing green manure crops like sun hemp, sesbania, cowpea and calapagonium in the coconut basin and their incorporation in situ is beneficial as the practice reduces the intensity of the root (wilt) and increases the nut yield. The ideal green manure crops for the sandy and alluvial soils are cowpea and sesbania, respectively. Under rainfed conditions, apply fertilizers in two splits, 1 3rd at the time of early southwest monsoon and 2 3rd before the northeast monsoon. Under irrigated conditions apply fertilizers in three equal splits (April-May, August-September and December-January).

After cultivation The basins of the trees are cleared of weeds and after application of manures and fertilizers covered with soil. Chemical fertilizers are not usually applied. If irrigation and fertilizers are given the stump will produce new shoots and it can be harvested again after 5 years. The seedlings are transplanted at a spacing of 5m x 5m in pits of size of 60 cm x 60 cm x 45cm covered with farm yard manure   2kg pit and top soil. Apply farmyard manure  10 t ha-1 at the time of field preparation. Apply farmyard manure after each harvest. In these trenches, FYM should be applied along with phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. The fertilizer may be applied on either side of the plants, along the row and earthed up. Organic manure, either FYM or compost   10 t ha-1 may be applied at the time of land preparation. The crop responds well to application of fertilizers especially N. The fertilizer requirement depends on the initial nutrient status of the soil. Fertilizer application is compulsory in seed production. Farm yard manure   25 t ha-1 and P2O5 and K2O   50 kg ha-1 each may be applied at the time of land preparation. Cowpea is also used as green manure crop and as cover crop in plantations. In less fertile soils like sandy coastal soils, phosphorus fertilizer should also be added along with sowing of seeds so as to help the development of root nodules. Gentle raking of the interspace after the application of fertilizers in the subsequent years may be done. 271 STYLO AND FODDER MAIZE GREEN MANURE CROPS Sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) It is a vigorous growing green manure crop, which can be incorporated at 10 weeks after sowing. rostrata) Sesbania aculeata It is a quick growing succulent green manure crop, which can be incorporated at about 8 to 10 weeks after sowing. Sesbania rostrata It is a green manure crop, which has nodules both on the stem and root. Wild indigo or kolingi (Tephrosia purpurea) It is a slow growing green manure crop suitable for light soils. Apply N, P2O5 and K2O fertilizers   60, 40 and 20 kg per ha, respectively. FODDERV SORGHUM AND GREEN MANURE CROPS 272 GREEN LEAF MANURE CROPS Gliricidia (Gliricidia maculata) It is a shrub, which takes up a tree habit under favourable conditions of soil and climate. 273 GREEN LEAF MANURE CROPS AILANTHUS OR MATTI (Ailanthus triphysa) Ailanthus trees flower in February-March and the fruit, a reddish brown samara, ripens in March-April, which represents the ideal time for seed collection. Fertilizers may be applied   30-40 g N, 15-20 g P2O5 and 15-20 g K2O per year per sapling from the second year to the fifth year and thereafter once in three years for a pure plantation. If the soil is sandy, mix farmyard manure with the topsoil. The rooted cuttings are then transferred to a mixture of sand, soil and farm yard manure (2:1:1) for hardening. Fertilizers may be applied at the rate of 20-25 g N, 15-20 g P2O5 and 15-20 g K2O per seedling per year from the second year to the fifth year. tereticornis also prefers moist and well-drained soils such as loamy sands or alluvial loams, with high nutrient availability. Fertilizers may be Maintaining a soil pH of 6. Fertilizers may be applied   30-40 g N, 15-20 g P2O5 and K2O per seedling per year from the second year to the fifth year. Fertilizers may be applied   30-40 g N, 15-20 g P2O5 and 15-20 g K2O per plant per year from the second year to the fifth year and thereafter once in three to four years for 10-12 years. fertilized, the quantities of chemical fertilizers applied to teak can be proportionately reduced or even skipped. Additionally, inclusion of nitrogen fixing trees such as Gliricidia or Leucaena (subabul) either in alternate rows or every third row not only improves teak growth but also saves chemical nitrogenous fertilizers. Fertilizers may be applied   40 g N, 10 g P2O5 and 75 g K2O per plant per year in 1-2 year old plantations. Leaves can be used as a bio fertilizer. Fertilizer mixture of 60-70 g N, 50-60 g P2O5, 50-70 g K2O along with 25-30 kg FYM per plant is recommended from 2nd or 3rd year onwards. Leaves are used as cattle feed and green manure. Oil cake is a fertilizer. Multipurpose tree species like ailanthus, teak, vellapine, silver oak and green manure yielding trees can be successfully interplanted in the older coconut plantation (preferably above 30 years of age), often in association with other field crops including medicinal plants such as kacholam. Fertilizers at the rate of 25-30 g N. This implied a departure from the previous practice of planning with focus on specific crops and fertilizers, treating the state as a unit of planning. The uplands of the unit have slightly acid or neutral red clay soils well supplied with bases and plant nutrients. The fertile soils are rich in bases and plant nutrients. After one or two months, the manure will be ready for application in the field. are converted to nutrient rich vermicompost by using earthworms as biological agents. Vermicompost contains major and minor nutrients in plant available forms as well as enzymes, vitamins and plant growth hormones. The vermicompost produced has an average nutrient status of 1. The nutrient level will vary with the type of material used for composting. The vermicompost produced has an average nutrient status of 1. The less enriched compost that remains in the pot can be collected and used as fertilizer. Recommendation for crops When vermicompost is applied as organic manure instead of FYM, the quantity of in-organic fertilizers can be reduced to about half the recommended dose. Repeat this VERMICOMPOST AND COIRPITH COMPOST 310 BIOFERTILIZERS The use of biofertilizers is important while practising integrated plant nutrient management as well as organic farming. Some of the commonly used biofertilizers in Kerala are as follows. Rhizobium (Bradyrhizobium and Azorhizobium) It induces better root nodulation and stem nodulation in inoculated plants and thereby brings down the requirement of nitrogen fertilizer for the cultivation of pulses, oil seeds and legume green manures. It fixes about 15 20 kg of N per ha under ideal upland conditions and thereby reduces the requirement of nitrogen fertilizers by 10-20 per cent. It fixes about 20-25 kg N per ha under ideal conditions, thereby effecting a reduction of 25 per cent in the quantity of N fertilizers required. Hence this biofertilizer is also recommended for rootinduction in polybag raised seedlings of plantation and orchard crops as well as vegetables. The coirpith is converted into good manure after 30-40 days and the lignin content is reduced from 30 per cent to 40 per cent. This coirpith compost contains macro nutrients as well as micronutrients. 311 VERMICOMPOST AND COIRPITH COMPOST AND BIOFERTILIZERS Inoculation for paddy: Mix 2 kg of culture in 60 litres of water and soak the seeds required for 1 ha (60 kg) for 24 hours before sowing. However, the use of this biofertilizer is not feasible in acidic soils with pH below 6. Enables the efficient utilization of cheaper sources of phosphatic fertilizers such as rock phosphate by the crop plants. There is also an enhanced absorption of water and other nutrients such as N and K and certain micronutrients. Application techniques of biofertilizers 1. The stickiness of the biofertilizer on seed surface can be significantly improved by using 10 per cent jagerry solution or 5 per cent sugar solution supplemented with 40 per cent boiled and cooled gum arabic solution or rice-gruel water. The treated seeds are spread evenly over a gunny bag and dried in shade and sown BIOFERTILIZERS 312 immediately in moist soil. The roots of seedlings to be transplanted are dipped in water slurry of the biofertilizer (500 g in 2. Soil application Soil application is generally recommended for all types of biofertilizers except Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium and Azorhizobium. The method is to apply the biofertilizer after mixing with dried FYM, compost or vermicompost at the rate of 1:25. For perennial crops, 10 to 25 g of the biofertilizer is to be applied in the root zone during the first year and 25 to 50 g during subsequent years. Factors influencing the efficient use of biofertilizers in Kerala 1. Use adequate quantity of organic manure (as per the recommendation for each crop) along with biofertilizer application. In moderately acidic soils, the application of lime at the rate of 250 kg ha -1 is recommended along with biofertilizer treatment. Irrigation is essential during summer months after biofertilizer application to ensure the survival of the introduced microbial inoculum in the soil. Since N biofertilizers can supplement only a part of the nitrogen requirement of the inoculated plant, low dose of nitrogen and full doses of phosphorus and potassium as per the recommendation may be applied. Similarly, in the case of P biofertilizers, the full doses of nitrogen and potassium should be applied. However, there should be a gap of at least one week between application of biofertilizer and chemical fertilizer. Use only biofertilizers, which are manufactured as per the quality para-meters prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards. In the case of bacterial biofertilizers, the prescribed standard is that in the final product, the population of the desired bacterium should not be less than ten million per gram of the carrier material and there should not be any contamination with other micro- organisms when examined at 1:100000 dilution. The commercially available biofertilizer should always be used before the expiry date marked on the culture packet. 313 BIOFERTILIZERS 9. Since a floating population of azolla can release its bound nutrients only during decay in the soil, it is essential to incorporate azolla in the soil prior to the transplanting of rice seedlings. BIOFERTILIZERS 314 GUIDELINES FOR MAXIMIZING FERTILIZER USE EFFICIENCY Choice of a fertilizer depends on unit cost of nutrient present in it and its agronomic efficiency under a given situation. Fertilizer is a valuable input and measures should be taken to reduce its losses and to increase its uptake and utilisation by the crop. Selecting a situa- tion-specific fertilizer and choosing the time and method of application according to crop demand would minimize losses and increase its efficiency. Nitrogenous fertilizers Most crop plants recover only 25-35 per cent of the nitrogen applied as fertilizers. Utmost care should be bestowed in selecting the type of fertilizer as well as the timing and method of application. Choice of the nitrogen fertilizer 1. In submerged rice soil, ammoniacal and ammonia producing fertilizers like urea are most suitable since ammonia is the most stable form of nitrogen under such conditions. For acidic upland soils, ammoniacal fertilizers are most suitable during rainy season since ammonium is adsorbed on soil particles and hence leaching losses are reduced. In alkaline upland soils of low rainfall regions, nitrate fertilizers are preferred to ammoniacal fertilizers or urea since ammonia may be lost by volatilization under alkaline conditions. Management of nitrogenous fertilizers 1. Almost all the nitrogenous fertilizers are highly amenable to losses and since most of the crops require nitrogen during the entire growth period, split application is necessary to ensure maximum utilization by crops. Nitrogen losses from fertilizers are more in coarse textured soils with low cation exchange capacity (CEC) than in fine textured soils. Hence more number of splits is necessary to reduce loss of fertilizer nitrogen from sandy and other light soils. For medium duration rice varieties, nitrogenous fertilizers should be given in three splits, as basal, at maximum tillering and at panicle initiation stage. In coarse textured sandy or loamy soils, the entire dose of nitrogenous fertilizers may be applied in 3-4 splits at different stages of growth of rice crop. 315 GUIDELINES FOR MAXIMIZING FERTILIZER USE EFFICIENCY 8. As far as possible, liming should be done one or two weeks prior to the application of ammoniacal or ammonia forming fertilizer like urea since ammonia is likely to be lost by volatilization if applied along with lime. Phosphatic fertilizers Fertilizer phosphorus is an expensive input and its management poses serious problems due to several complexities in its behaviour in different types of soil. This often results in its poor recovery from applied fertilizers. Choice of phosphatic fertilizer 1. In slightly acid, neutral or mildly alkaline soils, water soluble phosphatic fertilizers are more suitable. In wetland rice soils, water soluble phos- phatic fertilizers are preferable as pH of most of the submerged soils is near neutral. 0 even on submergence, phosphatic fertilizers containing citrate soluble form of P like basic slag, dicalcium phosphate, steamed bone meal etc. For highly acidic upland soils or submerged soils whose pH will not rise GUIDELINES FOR MAXIMIZING FERTILIZER USE EFFICIENCY 316 above 5. For short duration crops where quick response is required, water soluble phosphatic fertilizers are most suitable. In black soil (Chittur taluk of Palakkad District) phosphatic fertilizers containing water soluble phosphate like single superphosphate are most suitable. Management of phosphatic fertilizers 1. Acid soils have to be amended with lime, dolomite or magnesium silicate and alkali soils with iron pyrite or sulphur before application of phosphatic fertilizers. In single crop wetlands where rice is grown in the virippu season, application of phosphatic fertilizers can be dispensed with for the rice crop, if the second crop (usually legume or green manure) is given phosphatic fertilizers. In case of rice-legume cropping sequence in acid soils, application of rock phosphate to the pulse crop helps to skip phosphatic fertilizers in the succeeding rice crop. Since phosphorus requirement of seasonal crops is confined to the early stages, phosphatic fertilizers are to be applied at the time of seeding or planting. Top dressing of phosphatic fertilizer leads to wastage of the fertilizer nutrient. Further, excessive phosphates may lead to deficiency of micronutrients such as zinc, boron etc. Under adverse soil conditions and where quick result is required, spraying water-soluble phosphatic fertilizers like triple superphosphate or hot water extract of superphosphate can be resorted to. Potassium fertilizers For most crops, potassium can be supplied as muriate of potash. 317 GUIDELINES FOR MAXIMIZING FERTILIZER USE EFFICIENCY GUIDELINES FOR MAXIMIZING FERTILIZER USE EFFICIENCYAND BEEKEEPING 318 BEEKEEPING (APICULTURE) True honey bees belong to the family Apidae and genus Apis. Little bee (Apis florea): They are the smallest of the true honeybees found in plains Management of potassium fertilizers 1. In coarse textured soils and in heavy rainfall regions, potassium fertilizers should be applied in as many splits as possible, to reduce loss of potassium. In fine textured soils, the entire dose of potassium fertilizers may be applied as basal. In acid soils, potassium fertilizers should be applied only after lime application to prevent loss of potassium by leaching. Crops grown in such soils suffer due to unavailability of most plant nutrients, especially calcium. Application of liming materials increases the availability of nutrients and alleviates Ca deficiency. Fertilizers are applied   130:65:65 kg ha -1 of N:P2O5:K2O in two split doses. Fertilizers are applied   300:120:120 kg ha -1 of N: P2O5: K2O in five split doses. wherever cowdung is used as a manure. For the management of foot rot of Black pepper, Trichoderma harzianum is recommended by fortifying 50kg farmyard manure or neem cake with 1kg of the mother culture and incubated for 10-15 days before application in the field (  1kg vine). Application of Pseudomonas fluorescens at the rate of 10 g formulation mixed with 2 kg of well decomposed farmyard manure or compost and applied in the basin of pepper vine in the field can also help control foot rot. Chemical fertilizers and plant protection chemicals should not be used along with biocontrol agents. Incorporate the required quantity of organic manure in the soil and irrigate at the rate of 5 litres per m2. Biopesticides and fertilizers can be incorporated in soil after removing the polythene sheet. In general, culture medium consists of salts of major and minor nutrient elements, vitamins, amino acids, plant growth substances and a source of carbon.

The choice depends primarily on the availability of water. Wet method The wet method can be adopted in areas where water is available as in the second crop season. As far as possible, fertile lands with irrigation and drainage facilities should be selected for raising the nurseries. 14 RICE Irrigation may be commenced on the 5th day after sowing and continued up to the 7th day, to a depth of about 5 cm. Flooding the soil with too much water for long periods produces tall and weak seedlings, which do not readily recover during transplanting. Dry method This method is practised in areas where sufficient water is not available and the time of planting is uncertain. Water the nursery as and when required depending upon the receipt of rains. Kuttanad Drain out standing water from the main field. Maintain a thin film of water to facilitate sowing so that the germinated seeds do not get covered with clayey soil, which affects seedling establishment.

Pokkali and Kaipad By April, the bunds are being strengthened and sluices repaired for regulating water level. These baskets are then immersed in fresh water ponds for 12 to 15 hours. This system is practiced in areas where sowing   planting of mundakan crop is not possible due to excess water in the field. It is suitable for areas where efficient water management is possible (especially during rabi) and during kharif in areas where torrential rains are absent. In Kuttanad region, wherever wet broadcasting (direct seeding) is adopted, give the first basal application of the nitrogen at the time of letting in water after drying the field. Water-soluble phosphorus can be recommended for application in two split doses RICE 18 in Kuttanad region, as basal and at maximum tillering stage. In areas where availability of water is assured, temporarily draining the field one day prior to application and re-flooding after twelve hours is recommended for top dressing of fertilizer. Under special conditions of drought and water-logging, apply nitrogen as foliar spray. Split application of water-soluble phosphatic fertilizers in two equal splits as basal and at maximum tillering stage is effective in giving higher grain and straw yield than the full dose as basal dressing under certain situations. Water management Maintain water level at about 1. Drain water 13 days before harvest. 21 RICE Note: In areas where water for irrigation is assured and where acidity is high, draining and reflooding every 15 days is recommended. In flood prone areas, aged seedlings of Mahsuri or other varieties recommended for waterlogged conditions may be planted. During the mundakan crop season, water level of 5 cm need not be maintained continuously after the cessation of northeast monsoon. Five centimetre irrigation once in 6 days will be quite adequate for project areas where water is assured. For summer rice (in situation where the ground water level is low, i. , within 1m from the surface), 5 cm irrigation two days after disappearance of ponded water is sufficient instead of 5 cm continuous submergence throughout the crop period. Irrigation schedule for rice under limited water resources For summer rice under limited resources of water, phasic stress irrigation can be practised to the advantage of saving substantial quantity of irrigation water without any significant reduction in yield. About 20-30 per cent more area can be irrigated with the same water resources by adopting any of the following phasic stress irrigation schedules (Table 7). Depending up on the schedule, water saving ranges from 24-36 per cent of the requirement for 5 cm continuous submergence throughout the crop growth. Irrigation schedule for rice under limited water resources Schedule   Irrigation at 5 cm to be given at the stages marked. Maintain standing water in the field for good results. After two weeks, when most of the seeds would have germinated, destroy the germinated seedlings by ploughing the field or by spraying non selective herbicides like glyphosate or glufosinate ammonium   8 ml product litre of water. When the seedlings starts yellowing 4-5 days after herbicide application, let in water and flood the field to allow complete kill of the emerged seedlings. Pre sowing herbicide application to prevent the establishment of weedy rice seedlings After land preparation, drain the field to retain only a thin film of water. Allow the water in the field to evaporate. After three to four days, when the standing water has evaporated, broadcast pre germinated rice seeds. Mix 100 ml of the herbicide (formulation of glyphosate or glufosinate ammonium) in one litre of water. Herbicides should be applied only in areas where protected drinking water supply is available Precaution while using herbicides (1) Apply herbicides at the recommended dose and time. (7) Use 300-400 litres of water per hectare for spraying the herbicide. In areas where stem borer occurs as a serious pest in all seasons, apply any one of the following insecticides first 15-20 days after transplantation and then at the boot leaf stage keeping minimum water level: Cartap hydrochloride, Quinal- phos, Carbosulfan, Fipronil, Chlorantra- niliprole, Flubendiamide, Indoxacarb, Malathion or Spinosad. The granules should be broadcast in 2-3 cm of water and the field should be impounded for at least 4 days. Drain away water from the field and keep it in that conditions until the pest population dwindle. The cases may be seen floating on water also. Management Drain away the water from the fields. Feeding adversely affects absorption of water and nutrients. Symptoms on leaves appear as spindle shaped water soaked greyish green spots, which gradually enlarge in size and develop to spots with grey centre and brown margin. For early stages the quantity of insecticides can be reduced SP   Soluble Powder; DP   Dustable Powder; G   Granule; EC   Emulsifiable Concentrate; AF  Aqua Flowable; WP   Wettable Powder; S   Sprayable suspension SL   Soluble Liquid SC   Suspension Concentrate; WDG   Water Dispersible Granule. Ethofenprox 10  EC 750 ml ha Brown Plant Hopper Sheath blight (Rhizoctonia solani) Symptoms first appear on the lower leaf sheath near the water level as oval, oblong or irregular greenish grey spots, which enlarge and become greyish white with brown margin. Use 500 litres of water for high volume spraying and 200 litres for low volume spraying. Leaf blight symptom start as water soaked lesions on the tip of the leaves and increases in length downwards along the margins. Cut the affected plants at the base and dip it in a glass of water and hold it against the light for few minutes without shaking. Dissolve 20 g cowdung in one litre of water; allow to settle and sieve. Application of bleaching powder   5 kg ha-1 in the irrigation water is recommended for preventing the spread of bacterial leaf blight particularly in the kresek stage. This will help to reduce the cost of weed control and also the loss of water and nutrients through percolation. Form small bunds along the boundaries of the polythene sheet, after spreading it, to impound water. Sprinkle water over the seedbed for four days twice daily and keep soil in saturated condition. On 4th day remove the mulch and keep standing water to a height of 3 4th of seedling height. A thin film of water only is needed in the main field at the time of transplanting. (Too much water in the field will lead to floating of seedlings and too dry condition to non-anchoring of seedlings). Main field should have irrigation and drainage facility. Each female lays 20-30 eggs in rice stumps above the water level. Water bugs Water treaders They are solitary feeders Stem borer larvae and hoppers that fall on water surface. Mirid bugs 1 2 3 Water striders Each strider takes 5-10 prey daily. Rice hoppers, moth and larvae that fall on the water surface Ground beetle Hard bodied insects. Found on rice plant, water and ground surface; active during night. Paddy fields are inundated after rice harvest and fishes are released to the expanded water body.

Irrigation Irrigate the crop on the day of sowing and on third day. Subsequent irrigations may be given at 10-15 days intervals. Irrigation Irrigate the field on the day of trans- plantation. Irrigation at weekly intervals increases growth rate and yield. Irrigation Irrigate the crop on the day of sowing and thereafter at 10 days interval. Mix the inoculant uniformly with the seeds by using minimum quantity of water (instead of water, either 2. Make channels of 30 cm breadth and 15 cm depth at 2 m apart to drain off excess rainwater. 46 COWPEA Irrigation Giving two irrigations is highly beneficial; i. Irrigation at the flowering stage induces better flowering and pod set. Anthracnose of cowpea (Colletotrichum lindemuthianum) Causes water soaked lesions on leaves, which later become brown and enlarge to form circular spots. Channels, 30 cm broad and 15 cm deep, are drawn at 2 m apart to drain off excess rain water during kharif season and provide irrigation during summer season. If irrigation is necessary, provide furrows between rows for guiding water. Red gram can be grown in almost all soil types that are not very poor in lime and are not subjected to waterlogging. Though it can be grown in other seasons under irrigation, its performance will be poor. Land Preparation As waterlogging will affect germination and growth of the crop, it may be sown in raised beds during rainy season. 51 RED GRAM AND SOYBEAN Collar rot The diseases include collar rot (Rhizoctonia solani) which causes water soaked lesions at the collar region which later spread along the whole stem. Preparation of soybean milk Mature dry beans are washed thoroughly and soaked in water for 8-10 hours. Add water 6-8 times the volume of seeds and bring to boil. Soaking the beans for half an hour in hot starch water and then repeated washing with cold water is required. It is less tolerant to drought but cannot withstand water logging. Irrigation During summer and drought periods, it is essential to give 5-6 shallow irrigations to maintain soil moisture. If mature cormels are not harvested, most of them will sprout at rain, become watery and less suitable for consumption. Irrigation Ensure sufficient moisture in the soil at the time of planting. Subsequent irrigation may be given at 12-15 days intervals, depending on the moisture retention capacity of the soil. The irrigation should be stopped 3-4 weeks before harvest. About 9-12 irrigations are required for the crop till harvest. In the case of rainfed crop, if there is prolonged drought, supplementary irrigation is required. Plant protection Colocasia blight can be controlled by spraying mancozeb or copper oxychloride formulations at 2 g l-1of water (1 kg ha-1). The crop does not come up well in waterlogged conditions. Storing of cut sweet potato vines with intact leaves, in bundles covered with banana leaves (dipped in water) and kept under shade for two days prior to planting is recommended. Provide adequate drainage and prevent water logging. Irrigation When grown as irrigated crop, provide irrigation once in 2 days for a period of 10 days after planting and thereafter once in 7-10 days. Stop irrigation 3 weeks before harvest. But one more irrigation may be given 2 days before harvest. The application of N and K2O   50 kg ha-1 is recommended for the crop grown under irrigation. It can also be grown under irrigation where rainfall is low. The crop cannot survive waterlogged conditions and in such areas, it must be planted on mounds or ridges that permit drainage. Planting can also be done during February-April, provided sufficient moisture is made available through irrigation. Pit, flat, ridge or mound method of planting can be adopted depending upon soil type, topography of land and elevation so that waterlogging is avoided. For preventing dehydration, it is advisable to place the tip cuttings in water. Preparation of nursery: Select an area with well drained soil and irrigation facility. Irrigation Under conditions of well-distributed rainfall, tapioca grows well as a rainfed crop and irrigation is not necessary. When the crop is grown under irrigation, yield increase of 150-200 per cent over the rainfed crop has been observed. Furrow irrigation with 25 mm water at 100 mm CPE and alternate furrow irrigation with 50 mm water at 75 mm CPE require only less water and labour for optimum yield. Approximate irrigation interval schedules will be 27 and 20 days respectively in summer months. This recommendation is for shallow water table situations. For deep water table situations, the crop may be irrigated once in 24 days to a depth of 5 cm. Daily watering of the setts has to be done for the first 10 days and on alternate days afterwards. Supplementary irrigation may be given in the transplanted field till they get established. Under field conditions light infestation of mites can be controlled effectively by spraying the crop with water at 10 days interval from the onset of mite infestation. Select good, mature, medium sized nuts, which sink in water as seeds after drying in sun for two to three days. Soak seed nuts in water for 18 to 24 hours to hasten germination. Avoid excessive watering. (2) Quality seed nuts may be selected by immersing in water or 10 per cent saline solution. Seeds, which sink in water, may be selected. The seed nuts should be soaked in water overnight before sowing. Water the bags immediately after sowing and daily thereafter. Avoid excess irrigation. The grafts are to be watered regularly using a rose can or micro-sprinkler. The plants may be watered using hose. General pruning In older cashew plantations, removal of dried or dead wood, criss-cross branches, water shoots etc. Considering the fertility status of the soil, the level of management in terms of fertilization, irrigation etc. Soon after beheading, the stumps and cut portions should be given a swabbing with copper oxychloride and carbaryl 50 WP (50 g each per litre of water). Take 5g powdered sago in minimum quantity of water, heat and make into paste by stirring and cool it. Decant the clear juice and discard the sediment (gelatin may be dissolved in water by heating).

Irrigation In the case of irrigated crop, irrigate the plants once in two weeks. Copious irrigation during flowering will ensure good pod setting and good fibre quality. Lifesaving irrigation is to be given to all clonal plantings in the first three years. Regular but controlled watering and manuring are essential. The beds should be raised 10-15 cm above ground to avoid water logging and be of 90 cm width and convenient length. Seeds sprouted on each day should be picked into a vessel containing water to avoid injury. Seedling nursery Level lands with water table at least 60 cm below is ideal for raising seedling nursery. 5 kg in 700 litres of water per effective hectare if applied after preparation of beds prevent weed grown for 6 to 7 weeks. The cut end of stem is dipped in molten wax to prevent water loss. Regular watering and weeding is necessary. Well cured coir pith (washing with water at least for two months to leach out all toxic compounds) mixed with neem cake, bone meal, pesticides and single super phosphate is used as potting medium. Soil and water conservation: Formation of terraces is a recommended practice in hilly areas to conserve soil and water. In order to reduce erosion further and to facilitate rain water infiltration trenches of about 120 cm length, 45 cm width and 60 cm depth are taken along with contour in between the planting rows. The natural 85 RUBBER waterways existing in the plantation may be cleared or deepened to give adequate drainage. Mulching, shading, irrigation and whitewashing: The soil around the plants should be mulched properly before the onset of summer to conserve soil moisture, maintain optimum soil temperature and control weed growth.

Irrigation Irrigate the crop 8-10 times depending upon the availability of rains. In Chittoor area, more number of irrigations will be necessary. However, avoid too much moisture and water stagnation especially during germination and early growth phases. Alternate furrow with trash mulching could economise the use of irrigation water to the tune of 41 per cent during the formative phase of spring planted sugarcane as compared to all furrow irrigation with trash mulching. The disease is mainly transmitted through infected setts and flowing water and can be checked only by prophylactic means which are given below: 1. Water should not be let into a healthy crop from diseased areas and as far as possible, the field may be kept free of standing water by providing drainage channels. Irrigation is given as in plant crop. Avoid shallow soils with underlying hard rock, low-lying areas subject to water stagnation and heavy clayey soils. Chandralaksha (Lakshadweep Ordinary x Chowghat Orange Dwarf) Tender nut variety: Chowghat Orange Dwarf Keramadhura : A superior coconut suitable for tender nut and copra, with more quantity of nut water (287 ml) with excellent quality. For storing, arrange the seed nuts with the stalk-end up over an 8 cm layer of sand in a shed and cover with sand to prevent drying of nut water. Before sowing, examine seed nuts and discard those without nut water and rotten kernels. In low-lying areas and rice fields, form mounds to a height of at least 1 m above water level. The size of pits for planting would depend upon soil types and water table. In loamy soils with low water table, pit size of 1m x 1m x 1 m is recommended. Under assured irrigation, planting can be done during April also. Shading and irrigation For the first two years from planting, irrigate   45 litres of water per seedling, once in 4 days, during dry summer months. In the case of low lying areas, apply fertilizer after water table recedes in one single dose or in two split doses as conditions permit. Therefore, adequate supply of water is essential for its proper growth. In level lands, during rainy seasons excess water may be conserved in small trenches dug out in the plantation. This will facilitate maximum percolation of rainwater and water conservation. This will increase the water holding capacity of soil. In the case of low-lying areas, apply fertilizers in one single dose after water table recedes or in two split doses as conditions permit. Split doses can be applied with irrigation water in summer months. It ensures better land utilization, solar energy harvesting, efficient water use, utilization of soil nutrient resources, more returns and an insurance against crop failure. Summer: Vegetables Irrigation Irrigate the palms during summer months in basins around palms as shown in Table 25   26. Note: In coastal sandy soils, seawater can be used for irrigation. In irrigated gardens, interruption of irrigation would lead to serious set back in yield and general condition of palms. Hence, when once started, irrigation should be continued regularly and systematically. In sandy loam soil, irrigating the crop with 500 litres of water through basin taken at 1. Do not irrigate seedlings and very young palms with seawater. Drip irrigation In the traditional system of irrigation followed in coconut gardens such as flood irrigation, basin irrigation etc. irrigation efficiency is only 30 to 50 per cent due to considerable wastage of water. Scarcity of water and increasing cost of labour and energy are deterrents in adopting these traditional irrigation systems.

Some of the major advantages of drip irrigation are: it saves water, enhances plant growth and yield, saves energy and labour, most suited for soils having low water holding capacity and undulating terrain, reduces weed growth and improves efficiency of fertilizers. The water requirement for an adult palm is 40 to 50 litres per day. Add 30 to 40  to the above values depending upon the conveyance and application efficiencies in irrigation.

Leaf rot Symptoms The first symptom is the appearance of water-soaked brown lesions in the spear leaves of root-wilt affected palms. This can be prepared by mixing hexaconazole 5 EC 2 ml or mancozeb 3 g in 300 ml water. Growth cracks on the trunk, severe summer followed by heavy down pour, water stagnation, imbalance in nutrition, excess salinity and stress can act as predisposing   aggravating factors. Apply hexaconazole   25 ml in 25 litre of water as soil drenching once in four months. Avoid flood irrigation in order to prevent the possible spread of the pathogen through soil. The overall dimension 111 COCONUT Groundnut can be cultivated as a floor crop in coconut gardens, as an intercrop with tapioca and as a catch crop after second crop paddy with irrigation. Irrigation and interculture Irrigate the crop once in 7 days. The adult palms can withstand occasional waterlogging, but frequently waterlogged, extremely sandy and hard lateritic soils should be avoided. Nursery practices The fruits are separated from the bunch and seeds are extracted by scraping off the exocarp and mesocarp with a knife, or by retting in water. Seeds are soaked in water for five days, changing the water daily. After 80 days, the seeds are removed from polythene bags, soaked in water for 5 days changing the water daily and dried in the shade for two hours. Watering the seedlings weekly thrice is recommended. A fertilizer mixture containing 15 g N, 15 g P2O5 and 6 g K2O at the rate of 8 g in five litres of water for 100 seedlings may be applied when the seedlings are two months and eight months old. The disease can be controlled by spraying mancozeb or captan   200 g 100-1 litres of water. They are then sterilized in steam or boiling water for 30-60 minutes. It is then boiled in a clarification drum where the sludge will deposit and pure oil float over the water. 5  Thilarani Suited to summer rice fallows of Onattukara SESAME 116 Irrigation Usually the crop is grown under rainfed conditions. Stop irrigation just before the pods begin to mature. Surface irrigation at 3 cm depth during the critical stages, viz. Two irrigations of 3 cm depth each in the vegetative phase (4-5 leaf stage or branching) and in reproductive phase (at flowering or pod formation) are the best, registering maximum yield and water use efficiency. In the case of single irrigation, it can be best given in the reproductive phase. In the tail end fields in command area, best use of the sparingly available water can be made for augmenting sesame production. The site is selected in open, gently slopping and well-drained areas near a source of water. Provide irrigation once in a fortnight and adopt necessary plant protection measures. Cultural operations A regular schedule of cultural practices consisting of weeding, mulching, trashing, shade regulation, fertilizer application, irrigation, etc. The harvested capsules are washed in water to remove dust and soil particles. Nymphs are effectively controlled by spraying the lower surface of leaves with a mixture of neem oil (500 ml) and triton (500 ml) in 100 litres of water. On the infected leaves, water soaked lesions appear first and rotting and shedding of leaves along the veins occur thereafter. The cuttings are to be watered regularly 2-3 times a day for maintaining adequate moisture and prevent wilting. The well rooted cuttings can be transplanted to polythene bags filled with potting mixture and maintained in a shaded place and watered regularly. The well rooted air layers are separated from the mother plant and bagged in polythene bags filled with potting mixture and kept in a shaded place or nursery by watering the plants twice daily. Dehusk the fruits immediately after collection by soaking in water and peeling. Water the beds regularly. Provide shade and irrigation during breaks in the monsoon and summer. The crop cannot withstand waterlogging and hence soils with good drainage are preferred for its cultivation. Curing of vanilla involves immersing the beans (2-3 days after harvest) in hot water at a temperature of 63 to 65oC for three minutes for the cessation of vegetative life. Earth up the crop during the first mulching and avoid water stagnation. Spray neem oil (5 ml l-1 of water) in combination with the cultural control recommended for shoot borer. Rhizomes are soaked in water overnight and then cleaned. Water soaked lesions are seen on the fruits, the tissues of which become discoloured and disintegrated. Water stagnation in the soil, even for a very short period, is injurious for the plant. The cuttings are to be well protected from direct sunlight and frequent watering is recommended in the nursery to maintain a humid and cool atmosphere around the cuttings. Watering 2-3 times a day is sufficient. Heavy watering, which makes the soil slushy and causes water logging is to be avoided. Daily irrigation is to be given using a rose can. Press the soil around the cuttings and form a small mound slopping outward and away from the cuttings to prevent water stagnation around the plants. When pepper is grown in open places, shading and watering of the young seedlings may be done during summer months for the first 1 to 3 years according to necessity. Irrigation Irrigating pepper plants of Panniyur-1 variety at IW CPE ratio of 0. 25 from November   December till the end of March and withholding irrigation thereafter till monsoon break, increases pepper yield by about 50 per cent. The depth of irrigation recommended is 10 mm (100 litres of water per vine per irrigation at an interval of about 8-10 days under Panniyur conditions). The water is to be applied in basins taken around the plants at a radius of 75 cm. The irrigation schedule for AEUs of Wayanad district is given below.

Irrigating black pepper vines with 8 litres of water through drip per day during Oct - May enhances yield and quality in bush pepper with high B:C ratio. Wherever water stagnation is a problem, effective drainage of both surface and sub-soil is to be ensured. Heavy watering, which causes water stagnation is to be avoided. Instead, light and frequent watering should be resorted to. Blanching the berries in boiling water for one minute prior to sun drying accelerates browning process as well as the rate of drying. The bags are allowed to soak in slow running water for about one week during which bacterial rotting occurs and pericarp gets loosened. Then the berries are trampled under feet to remove any adhering pericarp, washed in water and then sun dried to reduce the moisture content to 10- 12 per cent and to achieve a cream or white colour.

It grows well in dry or occasionally waterlogged or flooded soils. Collect seeds from freshly harvested and fully ripe fruits and wash in running water and spread in a thin layer under roof. Method 3: Second method followed by transfer of the seeds to a white polypropylene cover of size 20 cm x 25 cm along with 30-50 ml of filtered water. Water the grafts daily using rose-can or micro- sprinkler. Grafts are to be watered daily using a rose-can or micro-sprinkler. Control them by spraying dichlorovos 1 ml per litre of water. Immediately after harvest, wash the fruits in running water and separate the fruit rind for processing. Regular watering till the plants establish in the field is a must. Varieties Mangala, Sumangala, Sreemangala and Mohitnagar, VTLAH1, VTLAH2 Selection of site Select sites with deep well drained soil without high water table. Provide adequate irrigation facilities. Provide irrigation during hot and dry periods and drainage during monsoon. Irrigation and drainage Irrigate the palms during hot and dry periods at regular intervals depending upon the soil type. In west coast, where major area of arecanut gardens are irrigated, watering the garden once in seven or eight days during November-December, once in six days during January-February and once in three to five days during March-April-May is recommended. In each irrigation, give about 175 litres of water per palm. Where there is shortage of water, follow drip irrigation. Construct drainage channels (25-30 cm deep from the bottom of pits) between the rows and drain out water during periods of heavy rainfall to prevent waterlogging. ) Force open the inflorescence out of the enclosing spathe and spray malathion 50 EC (250 ml in 100 litres of water). Avoid flood irrigation and water flowing from infected palms to healthy palms. Converted paddy fields   Provide deep drainage channels so as to keep the water below the root zone during monsoon. High water table predisposes the palm to this disease. Hyper nutrition or sudden flush of water after a period of drought or insufficient moisture in the soil is the probable cause (s) of the disease. Improvement of drainage in ill drained gardens and spraying of borax   2 g l-1 of water are found effective in reducing the disease incidence. Waterlogged, saline and alkali soils are unsuitable for its cultivation. Proper shade and irrigation are essential for successful cultivation of this crop. Preparation of land Areas with good shade and irrigation facilities are preferred for this crop. To prevent excess moisture in the soil, splashing water on the vines by hand is preferable in the early stages. In the absence of rain, light irrigation, four times daily, is given till establishment. Irrigation and drainage Betel vine needs constantly moist soil, but there should not be excessive moisture. Hence, frequent light irrigations are given. The quantity of irrigation water should be such that the standing water should not remain for more than half an hour in the bed. If waterlogging by heavy rains or excess irrigation occurs, drainage should be arranged immediately. The best time for irrigation is morning or evening. Lowering is followed by light irrigation and manuring. The treated leaves should be consumed marketed after thorough washing in water. The initial symptoms appear as small watersoaked regions, which enlarge and turn dark brown in the centre with yellow halo. Situations where the temperature falls below 10 C or rises above 38 C are unfavourable although minor deviations from the above limit can be adjusted by shade and irrigation. Regular watering is necessary to keep the soil moist. Bud wood can be stored by dipping in benzyl chloride followed by washing in water and then sealing the cut ends using molten wax. Planting should coincide with the onset of monsoon, but in places where irrigation is resorted to, flexibility in the time of planting is possible. Irrigation Cocoa grows well as a rainfed crop under conditions of well distributed rainfall and irrigation is not necessary. If sufficient moisture is not present in the soil due to prolonged drought or failure of rains, irrigation is to be given once in five days. Irrigation, however, helps in better growth of plants and precocity in bearing. On leaves, small water-soaked lesions appear which later coalesce resulting in the blightening of leaves. On stem, water-soaked linear lesions develop initially and later turn to black colour. Phytophthora canker (Phytophthora palmivora) The earliest symptom is the appearance of greyish brown water-soaked lesion with dark brown to black margin anywhere on the stem. Watering of the seed beds is to be done twice a day in the initial week and thereafter regulated. The prepared mixture is thoroughly mixed and slightly moistened with water to facilitate packing. Prior to transplanting, the nursery basket is watered and a vertical hole of 5 cm deep is made in the soil at the centre of the basket. Regular watering and aftercare of the seedlings should follow. Excess moisture and watering in the afternoon should be avoided as it may induce damping off. The beds are mulched and watered at regular intervals. Watering should be done during the early morning hours. Aftercare of seedlings Seedlings are to be manured once in two months with urea dissolved in water or supernatant solution of fermented cowdung slurry. 5 litres water is sufficient. The seedlings grow vigorously if watered judiciously and protected against afternoon sun. The soil around the seedling is packed 3 cm high above the ground to prevent stagnation of water around the collar. Irrigation Wherever water is available, overhead irrigation by sprinkler system is adopted to a greater advantage during November- January to keep the soil moisture level and in February-April for ensuring blossom as well as backing, if necessary.

Before sowing, seeds are put in water and only the sinkers will be used and floaters rejected. Manuring of nursery plants Composition of tea nursery mixture is as follows: Ammonium phosphate (20:20) 60 parts Potassium sulphate 24 parts (or) Muriate of potash 20 parts Magnesium sulphate 16 parts Stock solution Dissolve 30 g of the mixture in 10 litres of water. 5 are as follows (use water soluble P): The rate of fertilizer application for 177 TEA ensures proper spread. Sprinkle water periodically. Drench soil with mancozeb 30 g per 10 litres of water. The predisposing factors for the disease are deep planting, planting in gravelly soils, mulching closer to collar, wounds caused by weeding implements, fertilizer application close to collar, pegging, low moisture status in bark and surface watering during dry weather. It is sensitive to waterlogging. Watering may be done using rose-can. Do not let in irrigation water or drainage water from infested fields. For the summer crop, soak the seeds in water for 24 hours before sowing and give a spacing of 60 cm x 30 cm. After cultivation Give pre-sowing irrigation, if soil is not moist enough. For the control of nematodes, apply sawdust or paddy husk at 500 g plant or neem leaves or Eupatorium leaves at 250 g  plant in basins one week prior to planting and water daily. Irrigation at 15 mm CPE (approximately at 3 days interval for sandy loam soils) is more economical than irrigating once in two days especially during summer months for water economy. 2 ml malathion) mashed in 100ml water, kept in plastic bottles with 3 holes)   one trap per 8 plants.

For Palayankodan (rainfed), planting may 209 BANANA be done in January and the suckers may be given pot irrigation   9 litres of water once in 15 days until April-May. Irrigation 1. Ensure good drainage and prevent water logging. About 6-10 irrigations per crop may be given depending upon soil conditions. Nendran (October planting) grown under deep water table conditions (below 2 m from ground level) needs 10 mm (40 l plant) irrigation once in two days during summer season to ensure higher bunch yield and better water use efficiency. Pre harvest bunch spray Pre harvest bunch sprays of 3 per cent K2SO4 (3 g in 100 ml of distilled water) twice, the first two weeks after bunch emergence and the second four weeks after bunch emergence increases the fruit yield substantially and consumer preferences in Nendran banana. Any rise in water table or poor aeration of the soil is detrimental to the crop. Excellent drainage and adequate watering result in better performance. The crop cannot withstand waterlogging. In addition to the above manures and fertilizers, spray micronutrients such as zinc sulphate 500 g, copper sulphate 500 g, manganese sulphate 300 g and lime 500 g in 100 litres of water per ha twice in a year during March and October- November. Manuring Apply FYM compost and fertilizers at the rate indicated below: ii) Keep the soil moist by watering at an interval of 15-20 days. To control mango stem borer, apply paste made of crude carbolic acid (130 ml), soft soap (1 kg) and hot water (3. 0 g   tree, Time of application : September avoiding rainy periods Method of application: Dilute in 10 litres of water and drench soil at about 60 cm away from tree trunk. bassiana formulation   10 litre solution   40m2 under tree canopy (containing 20 g formulation litre) during fruiting season and post harvest treatment of harvested fruits with luke warm water (48oC) containing 1  salt for 15 minutes is recommended. It will not tolerate waterlogging around the trunk. Seed beds should be watered daily, if there is no rain. Irrigation The crop should be irrigated in summer. The ring system of irrigation is better for papaya than the basin system because the ring system prevents irrigation water coming into contact with the stem, thus preventing collar rot. Collar rot or stem rot Waterlogging and poor drainage are the chief contributing factors. Pineapple is tolerant to drought because of the special water storage cells. Pineapple can be grown in a wide range of soils, but does not tolerate waterlogging. Irrigation During summer months, pineapple should be irrigated wherever possible at 0. 6 IW CPE ratio (50 mm depth of water). It requires five or six irrigations during dry months at an interval of 22 days. 5 kg in 600 litres of water per hectare completely controls all types of weeds in pineapple plantation. 25 ml, urea 1 kg and calcium carbonate 20 g, made up to 50 litres with water. During summer months, if there are no summer showers after planting, irrigation should be given three weeks after planting for proper establishment. Wetlands   lowlands: Pineapple is highly sensitive to water stagnation and high moisture regimes. In paddy lands, pineapple is planted in paired rows at 45 cm x 30 cm spacing on ridges taken at 60-90 cm height, depending on the water table and drainage requirement. Wherever water stagnation and poor drainage are expected, a wider and deeper channel is given in between ridges. Irrigation Wherever irrigation facilities are available, providing irrigation in summer months at two weeks intervals results in good fruit size and high yield. If there is no irrigation facility, the crop should be scheduled for harvest before summer months (before March). Weed control Pre-emergence (within a few weeks after planting) spray of diuron   1 kg ha-1 in 600 litres of water can keep the field free of weeds for about four months. 5 ml of 10 per cent ethrel), 1 kg urea and 20 g calcium carbonate to 50 litres of water. The water table should be at least 60 cm below the soil surface. Irrigation Irrigation may not be necessary except during the early stages and in the hot weather; but good crops can be obtained with irrigation. Irrigation once in four days during early stages of growth up to one year of planting and later on, once in 7-10 days is necessary. Fresh cowdung or neem cake mixed with 10-15 times of water, kept for 4-5 days, can be sprayed on the plants after filtering. Cow s urine can be sprayed or drenched after mixing with 25 times of water. Water soluble fertilizer (19:19:19) 2 g   l is applied in the medium once a week. They produce aerial roots, which absorb water and nutrients from Plant protection Diseases The two major diseases are bacterial blight and anthracnose. Pests The major pests are scales and bugs, which are controlled by spraying malathion   2 ml per litre of water. A clear solution of fresh cowdung can be used for irrigation for a few days. One kg fresh cowdung mixed in 5 litres of water is sufficient for one square metre. The usual dose of such mixture is 2-3 g per litre of water, applied twice a week. Irrigation Constant and adequate water supply during peak flowering season (March-Octo- ber) is essential for high yield of flowers. Af- ter flowering is over, water supply can be cut off. Irrigation The crop has to be irrigated once in two or three days depending upon soil and weather conditions. A heavy irrigation once in 5-10 days is necessary depending upon the weather conditions. The application of fertilizers is to be necessarily followed by irrigation. Fill up the pits with soil completely so as to prevent water stagnation. After planting, press the soil around the seedling and form mound to prevent stagnation of water. Avoid water stagnation in the beds. Harvest the crop carefully without damaging the rhizomes, remove dried leaves and roots, wash the rhizome in water and dry. Dig out and burn the affected patches and irrigate with water charged with fish oil soap or emulsion spray oil to control the aphids. After digging out, the root tubers are cleaned by washing in water and marketed. It may be planted as a contour hedge on sloppy lands or can be used to protect the banks of major irrigation canals. An alternate method for enhancing germination is dipping the seeds in boiling water for a second. The stored seeds after soaking in water for 4-5 hours are sown on seedbeds. They are sown after soaking in water for 12 hours on the prepared beds. Regular irrigation is to be given till flowering. Germination can be substantially increased by treating the seeds with hot water (500 C) for a period of six to twelve hours prior to sowing. If irrigation and fertilizers are given the stump will produce new shoots and it can be harvested again after 5 years. Between the beds channel of about 30 cm depth have to be provided for easy drainage of water. Irrigation If it is a sole crop irrigation may be provided once in a week and as an intercrop in irrigated gardens, irrigation for the main crop will be sufficient for this crop also. If irrigation is not possible during summer months mulching using dried leaves is recommended. Cultivation It can be grown in any type of soil but cannot tolerate waterlogging. The seeds are dipped in water for 12 hours before sowing in the nursery. The seeds are dipped in water for 6 hours and are sown in furrows. After the harvest the roots are washed in water, dried and can be stored in air tight steel containers upto five months without quality deterioration. Cultivation It is grown in well-drained soil and cannot tolerate waterlogging. After 2 weeks, irrigate the crop   2 irrigations week. Keep the harvested produce in the field for 4-5 hrs to reduce the water content and weight of the produce. It comes up well on borders of water channels, wells and irrigated fields. During crop growth period wet condition should be maintained by providing irrigation. It cannot tolerate heavy clays or prolonged waterlogging. If irrigation facilities are available, topdressing can GUINEA GRASS 260 SETARIA GRASS (Setaria anceps) Setaria anceps is also called as Golden Timothy. At planting two irrigations are required within seven to ten days for quick establishment. Usually irrigation once in 7-10 days is required. Irrigation with cowshed washing or sewage water within 3-4 days after cutting gives better growth. If irrigation facilities are available, planting can be done at any time between February and November. The row-to-row distance may be increased to 60-70 cm when the soil is poor and irrigation facility is absent. At establishment, the crop requires two successive light irrigations in 7-10 days interval. Subsequent irrigation should be given as and when necessary. Total water requirement of the grass is about 800-1000 mm. The grass does not thrive well on waterlogged and flood prone lands. The field should be provided with good drainage during the rainy season, as the crop cannot withstand water stagnation. Frequency of irrigation depends upon the rainfall and weather conditions. 263 HYBRID NAPIER PARA GRASS (Brachiaria mutica) This grass is also known as buffalo grass, water grass, Angola grass and Mauritius grass. The crop responds well to sewage irrigation and is usually grown near large sewage disposal farms. It can withstand short term flooding and waterlogging but cannot be grown in dryland in arid and semi-arid regions. It can be grown even on sandy soils with good irrigation facility. The crop is highly responsive to irrigation with cattle-shed washing or sewage water. Two or three light irrigations are to be provided for the initial establishment of the crop. Later on, irrigation once in 10 to 15 days in summer is advantageous. It can be grown in almost all types of soils but cannot tolerate waterlogging. It cannot withstand waterlogging. To hasten germination seeds are to be dipped in concentrated sulphuric acid for four minutes and then washed or put in hot water at 80ºC for four minutes. Give irrigation if there is no rain. Fodder cowpea can be profitably grown as a summer crop in rice fallow of sandy loam soils where water is not available to raise a subsequent crop. The plant cannot withstand frost, excessive and prolonged waterlogging, while some varieties are resistant to heavy rains. Saline, alkaline or waterlogged soils should be avoided. Cowpea for fodder purpose can be grown in any month if irrigation facilities exist. In some species due to the presence of viscid hairs, they are not eaten in some Shallow furrows at 3 m apart for leading irrigation water may also be provided. A pre-sowing irrigation is important for the proper germination of the crop. If there is lack of soil moisture, shallow irrigation at 3-4 cm depth once in 15 days during summer and once in a month during post-monsoon period is good. Irrigation is required if there is no proper soil moisture at the time of sowing. Seeds are soaked in water overnight and mixed with Rhizobium culture before sowing. The crop can be raised throughout the year in areas where irrigation facilities are available. For seed production, irrigate with 33 mm of water once in 9 days during summer months from January to March. A total of 10 such irrigations are required during the period. It does not withstand waterlogging. It can be grown even under adverse condi- tions of drought, waterlogging, salinity etc. It thrives well under waterlogged condition. To get early, uniform germination and vigorous seedlings, seeds have to be scarified with concentrated sulphuric acid for 15 minutes and then washed thoroughly with fresh water and sown immedi- ately. It resists drought but does not withstand water stagnation. To hasten germination, the seeds are to be abrased with sand or steeped in hot water at 55ºC for two to three minutes. Better yield is obtained when two irrigations are given and when grown in clayey soil. The procedure involves soaking the entire quantity of seeds in cold (room temperature) water in the evening and draining the water next morning, followed by drying the seeds under shade during the day. These include, collection of non-timber forest products from forests, growing trees around wetlands and other water bodies in which fish culture is practised, apiculture with trees and multipurpose woodlots etc. Sowing is done after the bed is watered. After sowing, watering is done with a fine rose-can twice a day for 10-15 days and once a day afterwards. Regular watering and shading of the nursery beds are necessary to facilitate rapid seed germination. Trays should be kept moist with a fine spray of water until germination begins. Pre-sowing treatment and nursery practices To break dormancy of mangium seeds, hot water treatment is recommended. The seeds are tied in porous cloth and immersed in near boiling water (90 C) removed from the heat source for not more than 30 seconds. Pour off the water. Add cold water (room temperature) 20 times of the seed volume. Seedlings are hardened by progressively reducing watering and removing shade in the nursery. Being a strong light demander it does not tolerate overcrowding and does not withstand waterlogging. Teak seeds kept in jute sacks should be soaked in water during night time and dried in sun during day time. Sowing is done after the bed is watered. Providing life-saving irrigation during the summer season favours teak growth. Provide shade and water the beds regularly till the onset of monsoon but avoid waterlogging. It can be controlled by prophylactic fungicidal treatment and by regulation of shade and watering. It is necessary that cuttings should leave at least one node above the ground to prevent rainwater soaking into the rhizome. Soaking in cold water for 24 hours before sowing will result in 80 per cent germination. The beds are regularly watered and weeded. Collected pods are soaked in water and dried well after removing fleshy portion. Cold water dipping for 24 hrs will result in 30-40 per cent germination. If there is no rainfall, regular watering is essential. Soaking the seeds in cold water overnight enhances germination. It can resist damage by water. Soaking the seeds in cold water for 24 h will result better germination. Plants are generally sensitive and watering and weeding are important during the initial years of establishment of plantation. Seeds are collected from full grown trees and soaked in cold water for about 2-3 days before sowing. Drying of timber in sun light, after soaking in water for about 6 weeks is effective in improving durability and also useful for removing stains. Warm water treatment of seeds are found to be good for better germination. Soaking the seeds in cold water for 12 hours or warm water for 40 minutes is recommended for enhancing 293 CHADACHI AND PUNNA Plant protection Rotting is caused by fungi belonging to the genus Fomes. It can be kept in water for a long period of time without any damage. Watering is essential in summer months particularly during initial stages of development. In the tropics and subtropics, where sunlight and temperatures are not limiting, it is often the precipitation and the capacity of the land and soil to retain water that control biological productivity. It includes sandy beaches, sandy plains, coastal laterites and low lying areas such as estuaries, backwaters, submerged lands, swamps, marshes, kayal lands and broad valleys. AEU 4: Kuttanad Kuttanad is a special agro-ecological unit delineated to represent the waterlogged lands spread over 69 panchayats of Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts. Seawater ingress into Kuttanad is controlled through bunds and barrages to facilitate rice cultivation. Lowlands which dominate the unit, are under water the year round. Rice cultivation is made possible by dewatering (pumping out water from fields). However, seawater inundation is not controlled and hence soils are acid-saline. Seawater ingress into these lands is controlled through barrages and weirs to facilitate rice cultivation. AEU 7: Kaipad Lands The Kaipad Lands agro-ecological unit occurs along the coast of Kozhikkode, Kannur and Kasaragod districts as isolated stretches of waterlogged lands. The lowlands, often below sea level, do not have any protection against sea water inundation. This layer is well moistened by sprinkling cowdung slurry and water over it. After three months of decomposition, the mass is taken out of the trench and formed into a conical heap above the ground, moistened with water if necessary and covered with soil. At the bottom of the pit, a layer of coconut husk is spread with the concave side up to ensure drainage of excess water and also for proper aeration. The husk is moistened and above this, biowaste mixed with cowdung in the ratio of 8:1 is spread up to a height of 30 cm above the ground level and water is sprinkled daily. Adequate moisture level should be maintained by sprinkling water whenever necessary. Sufficient moisture level should be maintained by occasional sprinkling of water. Two litres of water is sprinkled over the compost containing worms. It is sprinkled with 2 litres of water. The hole situated at the bottom of the pot is fixed with a water tap through which vermiwash is collected. After the formation of compost, the entire mass is soaked with two litres of water. Moisten the seeds by sprinkling water or rice-gruel water. Seedling root dip (for transplanted crops): Slurry of the culture is prepared by mixing 500 g culture with 50 ml of water and the roots are dipped in the slurry for 15 20 minutes before transplanting. Sprinkle water if necessary to keep the heap moist. It improves the water infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity of soil. 311 VERMICOMPOST AND COIRPITH COMPOST AND BIOFERTILIZERS Inoculation for paddy: Mix 2 kg of culture in 60 litres of water and soak the seeds required for 1 ha (60 kg) for 24 hours before sowing. At the time of transplanting, dip the roots of seedlings for 15-20 minutes in the culture slurry prepared by mixing 2 kg inoculum with 40 litres of water. There is also an enhanced absorption of water and other nutrients such as N and K and certain micronutrients. 25 litres of water. The stickiness of the biofertilizer on seed surface can be significantly improved by using 10 per cent jagerry solution or 5 per cent sugar solution supplemented with 40 per cent boiled and cooled gum arabic solution or rice-gruel water. The roots of seedlings to be transplanted are dipped in water slurry of the biofertilizer (500 g in 2. 5 litres of water) for 20 minutes, prior to transplanting. Irrigation is essential during summer months after biofertilizer application to ensure the survival of the introduced microbial inoculum in the soil. In areas where split application of nitrogen is not feasible due to water stagnation after planting sowing, full dose of nitrogen as basal may be given in the form of neem coated or coal tar coated urea. Sulphur or lac coated urea is suitable where soil is liable to intermittent flooding and in situations where water management is difficult. In slightly acid, neutral or mildly alkaline soils, water soluble phosphatic fertilizers are more suitable. In wetland rice soils, water soluble phos- phatic fertilizers are preferable as pH of most of the submerged soils is near neutral. For short duration crops where quick response is required, water soluble phosphatic fertilizers are most suitable. In black soil (Chittur taluk of Palakkad District) phosphatic fertilizers containing water soluble phosphate like single superphosphate are most suitable. Under this situation, phosphorus in rock phosphate gets converted to iron phosphate, which on subsequent waterlogging becomes available to the rice crop. Under adverse soil conditions and where quick result is required, spraying water-soluble phosphatic fertilizers like triple superphosphate or hot water extract of superphosphate can be resorted to. Communication The worker bees communicate with other bees about the exact location of nectar, pollen, water, next nesting site etc. Location of beehives The apiary must be located in well-drained open area, preferably near orchards, with profuse source of nectar, pollen and water. Processing of honey Heat the honey to 45ºC by keeping it in a water bath. Again heat it to a temperature of 65ºC in water bath and maintain it for 10 minutes. Sources of pure water should be available near the apiary. Stagnant water or water in a container is not appropriate because it can spread nosema disease. Flowing water near the apiary should serve as a good source. As an alternative, water trickling from a container set on a stand and falling on a slanting wooden plank can be provided. Provide artificial feeding once in a week by way of 1:1 sugar syrup in water. Collection and destruction of egg masses, deep ploughing and flood irrigation to kill the pupae and application of 0. Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus): These rats are found in waterlogged areas. The tillers are cut at the water level. The pot and the plank are tightly held and removed in that position and immersed in water after inversion for killing the trapped rat. Kerosene tin trap: It is made by cutting the top of the tin and filling it with water up to 15 cm from the top. Chaff is floated on the water surface so that the rat cannot see water. Seeing no water and eager to get the bait the rat jumps on to the chaff and gets drowned. Two month old potatoes are procured, washed in water, disinfected using 5  Sodium hypochlorite solution. ECOFRIENDLY MANAGEMENT OF WATER HYACINTH (Eichhornia crassipes) IN WATER BODIES Water hyacinth in water bodies can be managed by spraying 5 per cent Cashew Nut Shell liquid (CNSL) emulsion followed by spraying 40 per cent Wetable Powder formulation (WP) of Fusarium pallidoroseum (5 per cent). Slice the bar soap and dissolve in 500 ml of water. Dilute this one litre solution by adding 9 litres of water to get 10 litres of 5 per cent CNSL emulsion. In moving water bodies fencing with rope and coconut leaf is recommended. Dry neem cake and cowdung are to be powdered and mixed at 1:9 ratio to get a coarse texture and then moistened by sprinkling water. For seed treatment in paddy the talc based culture may be added to the water used for sprouting at the rate of 10 g per kg of seed. Moisten with 335 SOIL SOLARIZATION water using a rose-can and cover the soil with polythene sheet and solarize for 20-30 days as described above. However, excessive seepage of water into the bed during solarization should be avoided. One kg of well dried, one year old paddy straw is cut into small bits of 5-8 cm in length and immersed in water for 18 hours. Then the soaked straw is taken out from water and kept inside the basket for 1-2 hours to drain away excess water. The soaked straw is kept under boiling water (100ºC) for 30-40 minutes for surface sterilization or to achieve pasteurization and then taken out and kept inside the basket to drain excess water and is allowed to cool to room temperature. If temperature inside the room rises above 30ºC, the room should be sprinkled with water to lower the temperature. Management of Pests and contaminants of Oyster mushrooms in Kerala   Maintain the pH of the water used to soak the substrate at 8. The twists are tied into small bundles and are kept immersed in clean water in tanks for about 6 to 12 hours. After this, the bundles are taken out and kept aside for some time to drain the excess water. After placing the last of twists, press the bed thoroughly from the top in order to drain excess water. Make up the volume to approximately 950 ml with distilled water. The explants are washed in running tap water first and then in soap solution. After surface sterilization, the explants should be washed with sterile distilled water four to five times to remove the residues. A period of humidity acclimatization is necessary for the newly transferred plantlets to adapt to the outside environment, during which the plantlets undergo morphological and physiological adaptations, enabling them to develop typical terrestrial plant-water control mechanism. Wash the harvested produce in plain water or in chlorinated water to clean it of the adhering mud, dirt and residual pesticides.

Harvesting for seed purpose can also be done leaving a border row of 3 m within the field. Drain water at least one week before harvesting to ensure that the plants attain uniform maturity at harvesting. Harvest the crop when 80 per cent of the grains in a panicle are mature (at physiological maturity). Thresh the sheaves on the same day of harvest, as seeds of heaped sheaves may not perform well. Seeds of short duration varieties like Jyothi and Triveni of virippu crop reach this level of germination 9-10 months after harvest and that of mundakan 8-9 months after harvest when stored under ambient conditions.

For Thiruvananthapuram and Malappuram districts, phosphorus application is essential for increasing rice yields. In sequential cropping of rice, application of 50 per cent of the nutrient requirement (on nitrogen equivalent basis) as organics (FYM, rice straw, green manure) and 50 per cent as fertilizers during kharif season and the entire dose of nutrients as fertilizers in rabi season enhances the grain and straw yield. Application of 25 per cent of the nutrient requirement as organics and 75 per cent as fertilizers during kharif season and reducing the fertilizer dose of rabi by 25 per cent gives comparable yield with full POP recommendation during both seasons. Specific dose of fertilizer for Koottumundakan system A fertilizer dose of N:P2O5:K2O 20:10:10 kg ha-1 for the first crop and 30:15:15 kg ha-1 for the second crop is recommended for high yield in Koottumundakan system. The fertilizer for second crop may be applied as a single dose immediately after the harvest of the first crop (ad hoc recommendation). Split application of water-soluble phosphatic fertilizers in two equal splits as basal and at maximum tillering stage is effective in giving higher grain and straw yield than the full dose as basal dressing under certain situations. Application of magnesium as basal dose in the form of magnesium sulphate (16 per cent MgO) or magnesite (40 per cent MgO) or dolomite (10 per cent MgO)   20 kg MgO ha is effective in giving a significant increase in grain and straw yield of rice in magnesium deficient soils. In non- deficient soils, a marginal increase in grain and straw yield is also obtained. In iron toxic laterite soils of Kerala, application of 120 kg potash ha-1   lime 150 kg ha-1   silica 100 kg ha-1 (as sodium silicate 250 kg ha-1 or fine silica 100 kg ha-1 or rice husk ash 500 kg ha-1) is recommended for higher yields. Drain water 13 days before harvest. Irrigation schedule for rice under limited water resources For summer rice under limited resources of water, phasic stress irrigation can be practised to the advantage of saving substantial quantity of irrigation water without any significant reduction in yield. Grain yield reduction in the above practice is only 0. In seriously affected patches, yield is substantially reduced. Harvest the crop at optimum moisture content in order to avoid loss due to shedding and also for improving the recovery of rice. Paddy harvest will be over in 120-125 days. Paddy fields are inundated after rice harvest and fishes are released to the expanded water body. The fishes are harvested prior to the next paddy season. Rice fields require no land preparation and preliminary weeding if the plant stand establishment is taken up within one week after the fish harvest. Irrigation at weekly intervals increases growth rate and yield. Harvesting Harvest the crop when the ears are yellowish brown. Heap the harvested ears and cover the heaps with ragi straw for 2-3 days before threshing. Sumanjana is high yielding and early maturing variety, suitable for summer rice fallows of Trivandrum district. During summer, cowpea can be grown as a pure crop in rice fallows after the harvest of paddy. Floor crop : Gujarat V-118, CO-2 Seeds and Sowing Seed rate For grain and dual purpose type Broadcasting : 60-65 kg ha-1 (45 kg ha-1for Krishnamony) Dibbling : 50-60 kg ha-1 (40 kg ha-1 for Krishnamony) Spacing : 25 cm x 15 cm Dibbling two seeds per hole Bush : 30 cm X 15 cm Trailing : 2 m X 2 m (on pandal   three plants per pit) Sowing Soaking seeds in 500 ppm thiourea solution, followed by two sprays of thiourea (one at vegetative and another at flowering stage) increased the yield of cowpea by 26 per cent and net return by 50 per cent. Adoption of mechanical methods of pest control such as application of ash at 10 DAS, keeping yellow sticky trap  yellow pan tray, collection and destruction of infested leaves, flower buds and pods and sweeping and destruction of the pests. Collection and release of potential natural enemies viz. Pods become ready for harvest in 50-60 days in the case of bush beans and in 70-80 days for the pole beans. The average yield of green pods is 8-10 t ha-1.

Optimum growth and yield are obtained in deep loam soils. Pods can be harvested when the grains are fully developed. In short duration varieties, harvesting will be over within 100-120 days while long duration varieties will normally take 140-160 days. Stop application of chemicals 10 days before harvesting. gram can also be sown in paddy fields after the harvest of mundakan crop. Harvesting and yield The crop will be ready for harvest in about 4 months after sowing. If the period is rainy, the crop may be harvested after leaf shedding and the produce may then be dried in shade for about 10 days. Harvesting The crop will be ready for harvest 8-9 months after planting. Maintenance of adequate soil moisture, proper shade to sustain a humid microclimate and avoiding full exposure to sunlight is a must for good crop growth, better tuber and leaf yield. Harvesting Crop can be harvested when older leaves start yellowing and drying usually during 9-11 months of planting. As the corms and cormels do not deteriorate if left un harvested, harvesting can be done from 6 months till 10-12 months. If mature cormels are not harvested, most of them will sprout at rain, become watery and less suitable for consumption. Storage of seed material After harvesting, curing of the corms and cormels is done under sunlight for 4-5 days. Care should be taken to avoid injury to the corms and cormels while harvesting. Sree Rashmi -Economic yield under low input levels, conical cormets and 7 months duration. The leafy parts may be smothered about one month before harvest so as to enhance tuber development. The irrigation should be stopped 3-4 weeks before harvest. About 9-12 irrigations are required for the crop till harvest. Harvesting Colocasia becomes ready for harvest five to six months after planting. The mother corms and side tubers are separated after harvest. Harvesting The crop becomes ready for harvest within 8-9 months after planting when the vines are completely dried up. Harvesting The crop is ready for harvest by about 7-8 months time. Tuber yields of 20-25 t ha-1 can be obtained by following the improved methods of cultivation. Vines obtained from the freshly harvested crop are also planted in similar nursery area to obtain sufficient planting material. Stop irrigation 3 weeks before harvest. But one more irrigation may be given 2 days before harvest. IW   CPE for higher tuber yield in non-rainy periods is 1. Rotation and mixed cropping Under irrigated conditions, sweet potato can be rotated with rice and planted during December-January after harvest of the second crop of rice. Under rainfed conditions, green manure crops such as kozhinjil and sunnhemp can be grown after harvest of the sweet potato and later incorporated into the soil at the time of land preparation for the succeeding crop. Harvesting The duration of the crop depends on the variety; but in general, the crop can be harvested in about 3. Harvest the crop when leaves begin to turn yellow and the tubers mature. Harvest the crop by digging out the tubers without causing injury. But the harvest can be prolonged even up to 16 months. Sree Prakash: This has seven months duration and the yield potential is 30-40 t ha-1. Nidhi: This is a high yielding early variety with 5. Vellayani Hraswa: High yielding early variety with 5-6 months duration. Harvested stems are to be stored vertically in shaded and well-aerated places. 5 kg ha-1 (1g plant-1) in small channels around the mounds within 2 months of planting cassava providing an interval of 2 weeks between the application of these fertilizer enhances tuber yield and quality. When the crop is grown under irrigation, yield increase of 150-200 per cent over the rainfed crop has been observed. Furrow irrigation with 25 mm water at 100 mm CPE and alternate furrow irrigation with 50 mm water at 75 mm CPE require only less water and labour for optimum yield. After the harvest of pods, the haulms are incorporated in the soil along with a top dressing of 50 kg each of N and K2O per ha for the main crop. Screening for disease symptoms and roguing of infested plants may be continued in field at weekly intervals upto harvest. Harvesting Tapioca becomes ready for harvest 9-10 months after planting. Hybrid varieties like H-226, H-97 and H-165, when grown under recommended management practices have recorded yields up to 40-50 t ha-1 of raw tuber. Harvesting Harvest the crop 5 months after planting. It grows and yield best in well-drained red sandy loams and light coastal sands. Cashew varieties Varieties   hybrid   types Mean yield Nature of (kg tree year) bearing Anakkayam-1 (BLA 139-1) 12. (3) Bearing nuts of medium size and weight (5-8 g nut) with an average yield of 15 kg nuts per annum. Softwood grafting Selection of seed nuts (1) Seed nuts may be collected during the peak period of harvest (February-March) and sun- dried for 2-3 days. Selection of scions (1) Select a high yielding variety of cashew as mother plant to collect adequate number of scions. Collection of scions (1) The pre-cured scions are to be cut early in the morning to avoid desiccation. Initial training and pruning of cashew plants facilitate easy cultural operations such as terrace making, weeding, fertilizer application, nut collection and plant protection. If uniform management practices are adopted, during early years of yield, the per tree nut yield will be more or less the same with all the trees, in both the conventional system of planting and in high density planting. But the per hectare yield will be more from high-density plantations (due to higher plant population) compared to the normal density plantations. The bonus yield obtained during the early years of yield would be substantial in high-density plan- tations. Top working can successfully rejuve- nate poor yielders in the age group of 5-20 years. New, 20-25 days old shoots should be grafted with scions of high yielding variet- ies using softwood grafting technique. The top worked trees start yielding right from the second year after top working. Take out the fruits on the 4th day and wash Post Harvest Utilization of Cashew Apple Cashew apple is a valuable source of sugars, minerals and vitamins especially vitamin C and can be used for preparation of various products. Harvesting The bolls start bursting 100-120 days after sowing and will be ready for harvest at this stage. 280, PB 312, PB 314, PB 235, RRII 5, RRII 300, PB 311  and RRII 105  have exhibited good growth and yield in the region. This dose should also be applied 2-3 months after each harvest of bud wood. The first harvest of brown bud wood is done one year after planting by cutting the shoot 30 cm above the bud union. Two sprouts are allowed to grow for the second harvest after similar growth. Most of the modern high yielding clones are prone to tapping panel dryness when tapped under half spiral alternate daily system. , coffee, cocoa and vanilla on Glyricidia standards can be cultivated as intercrops without adversely affecting growth and yield of rubber and soil fertility from the young phase onwards. When perennial crops are cultivated with rubber, yield will decrease after canopy closure of rubber. Harvesting Tapping Latex is obtained from the bark of the rubber tree by tapping, a process of controlled wounding during which thin shavings of bark are removed. Hence, high yield is obtained by tapping to a depth of less than one millimeter close to the cambium. ) is good for higher yield. For high yielding clones (RRII 105, RRII 400 series clones, PB 260, PB 235 etc. Alternate daily tapping can be practiced only for medium yielding clones (RRIM 600, GT 1, PB 28 59 etc. Low frequency tapping (LFT) Low Frequency Tapping (LFT) with yield stimulation using ethephon (2-chloroethyl phosphonic acid) can be practiced from the first year of tapping to reduce the cost of tapping and increase productive life of trees and timber volume. Controlled Upward Tapping Controlled Upward Tapping (CUT) is a proven harvesting practice to achieve sustainable high yield for long term from old and senile trees. In general 30-50 per cent higher yield can be obtained for many years under CUT. For third daily (d3) tapping of quarter spiral cut in the high panel, monthly stimulation is enough for high yielding clones (like RRII 105) and stimulation at once in three weeks intervals is necessary for medium yielding clones. Delay in planting reduces cane yield. Affected crop should be harvested as early as possible to prevent loss in yield and deterioration in quality and also to arrest further spread of the disease. The crop residues should be completely burnt after harvesting. Harvesting Harvest the crop when it is fully mature. Delayed harvesting will reduce yield and recovery percentage. Manure the crop by 25th and 75th days after harvest of the previous crop. Yield -119 nuts palm; copra yield (196 g nut). Regular bearing habit and yielding not less than 80 nuts   annum. If the mother palms are the progeny of elite planting material and gives consistently higher yields for a period of not less than 6 years, seed nuts can be collected from such palms. Collection and storage of seed nuts Collect mature nuts (above 11 month old) during the period from December to May. In the case of nuts harvested in May, heap them in partial shade, till husk is well dried and then sow them in the nursery. Moisture stress leads to stunted growth, drooping of leaves, immature nut fall and decreased yield. Hybrids   high yielding palms (a) For irrigated areas 1. The N:P2O5:K2O recommendation given for high yielding palms is, in general, sufficient for palms yielding upto 100 nuts per year. For palms yielding more than 100 nuts per year, an additional dose of 10 g N, 101 COCONUT 5 g P2O5 and 15 g K2O may be supplied for every nut exceeding 100 nuts. It ensures better land utilization, solar energy harvesting, efficient water use, utilization of soil nutrient resources, more returns and an insurance against crop failure. The casuarina poles will be ready for felling  harvesting within 5-6 years of planting. In irrigated gardens, interruption of irrigation would lead to serious set back in yield and general condition of palms. Some of the major advantages of drip irrigation are: it saves water, enhances plant growth and yield, saves energy and labour, most suited for soils having low water holding capacity and undulating terrain, reduces weed growth and improves efficiency of fertilizers. Nursery The nuts should be harvested before it is tree-ripe and sown immediately in the bed  NBSSLUP classification (Nair et al. The infested palms turn pale yellow and there will be considerable reduction in yield. Collection and destruction of adults during the monsoon period from adjacent vegetation (in the evening). Uneven growth results in distortion and stunting of nuts leading to reduction in copra yield. Management Coconut root (wilt) is a non-lethal debilitating disease and the affected palms survive for a long period giving a reasonably good yield. Rogue out palms that are affected severely by root (wilt) and yield less than 10 nuts   palm   year and those, which have contracted the disease before flowering. Replant with disease tolerant material   high yielding hybrids (Chandrasankara). Growing green manure crops like sun hemp, sesbania, cowpea and calapagonium in the coconut basin and their incorporation in situ is beneficial as the practice reduces the intensity of the root (wilt) and increases the nut yield. Harvesting The crop will be ready for harvest when the leaves start yellowing and begin to dry up. When the palms are yielding, judicious pruning to retain about 40 leaves on the crown is advocated. It is necessary to remove some of the leaves while harvesting. Harvesting First harvest can be taken 3. When a few ripe fruits are loose  fall off, the bunch is ready for harvesting. A chisel is used for harvesting bunches from young palms. When the palms become taller (from 10 year onwards) a harvesting hook has to be used. When the palms are too tall, it is necessary to climb the palms for harvesting. , 4-5 leaves, branching, flowering and pod formation will increase the yield by 35-52 per cent. Two irrigations of 3 cm depth each in the vegetative phase (4-5 leaf stage or branching) and in reproductive phase (at flowering or pod formation) are the best, registering maximum yield and water use efficiency. Harvesting Harvest the crop, when the capsules turn yellowish by pulling out the plants. Harvest during the morning hours. Uproot a part of the high yielding disease free mother clump identified in the plantation. This method is practiced if the cultivar yields fruits that turn yellow before they are ready for picking and where facilities for green curing are not available. Harvesting and processing Cardamom plants normally start bearing capsules from the second year of planting. After harvest, cardamom capsules are processed. Capsule should be processed within 24-36 hours after harvest to prevent colour deterioration. Harvesting is done almost round the year in Kerala with the peak period from August - October. The harvested capsules are washed in water to remove dust and soil particles. The CARDAMOM 120 Oleoresin Solvent extraction of ground spice yields 10 per cent oleoresin. For controlling the leaf caterpillars, mechanical collection and destruction and spraying of any contact insecticide are recommended. Sow seeds immediately after harvest on raised beds. Harvesting and curing The plants will be ready for harvest in about 3 years after planting. Harvesting is done during two seasons, the first in May and second in November. Oleoresin yield varies from 10 to 12 per cent. Cinnamon leaf oil Cinnamon leaf oil is produced by steam distillation of leaves yielding 0. Collect fully developed fruits from high yielding mother trees. Dehusk the fruits immediately after collection by soaking in water and peeling. Harvesting and curing The trees begin to yield from 7-8 years after planting. The stage of harvest of flower buds determine the quality of the final dried product. Buds are harvested when the base of calyx has turned from green to pink in colour. Clove leaf oil Clove leaves on distillation yield 2-3 per cent oil as a dark brown liquid with a harsh woody odour. The spraying has to be commenced just prior to flower bud formation and continued till the harvest of flower buds for effective control. Pollination, harvesting and curing Flowering of vine commences usually by about the third year. Collect the pods at this time, as this is the optimum time for harvesting the pod. Free vanillin is not present in the beans when they are harvested. Curing of vanilla involves immersing the beans (2-3 days after harvest) in hot water at a temperature of 63 to 65oC for three minutes for the cessation of vegetative life. 131 GINGER The process include   Selection of healthy rhizomes of high yielding varieties of ginger. Grow green manure crops like daincha and sun hemp in the interspaces of beds, along with ginger and harvest the green manure crop during second mulching of ginger beds. Harvesting and processing For vegetable ginger, the crop can be harvested from sixth month onwards. For dry ginger, harvest the crop between 245-260 days. After harvest, the fibrous roots attached to the rhizomes are trimmed off and soil is removed by washing. The yield of oil varies from 1. Commercial dried ginger yields 3. The seeds should be sown immediately after collection. Harvesting Fruits are available throughout the year, but the peak period of harvest is from June to July. Yield of oleoresin is 10-12 per cent for nutmeg and 10-13 per cent for mace. The yield ranges from 7 to 16 per cent. Mace oil The mace yields 4-17 per cent colourless to pale yellow liquid possessing organoleptic properties similar to nutmeg oil. Any dry spell, even for a few days, within this critical period will result in substantial reduction of yield. Select mother plants, which give regularly high yields and possess other desirable attributes such as vigorous growth, maximum number of spikes per unit area, long spikes, close setting of berries, disease tolerance etc. Pepper yields are promising when trees are grown in high density (3 x 3m spacing; 1111 trees ha-1) block plantations. Both the tree species provide additional economic returns through timber yield at final harvest. Banana as an intercrop in yielding gardens reduces pepper yield. Underplanting After regular bearing for about 20 years, the vines of most varieties start declining in yield. The age of decline in yield varies with variety and agroclimatic and management factors. So underplanting should be attempted at about 20 years after planting or when a declining trend in yield appears. 5 per cent during flowering and pin head stage of black pepper is recommended in zinc deficient areas of black pepper cultivation for increasing the yield and quality. 25 from November   December till the end of March and withholding irrigation thereafter till monsoon break, increases pepper yield by about 50 per cent. Irrigating black pepper vines with 8 litres of water through drip per day during Oct - May enhances yield and quality in bush pepper with high B:C ratio. Infestation by mussel scale causes significant loss of yield as it affects all parts of plant including berries. 05 per cent at fortnightly intervals after the harvest of berries effectively control black pepper mussel scale. Waiting period of insecticide   fungicide Dimethoate 20 days Quinalphos 20 days Mancozeb 30 days Harvesting and processing Black pepper Black pepper of commerce is produced from whole, unripe but fully mature berries. The harvested berries are piled up in a heap to initiate browning. Bright red berries, after harvest are detached from the stalk and packed in gunny bags.

Dehydrated green pepper In this method, under-mature berries are harvested and subjected to heat treatment for inactivating the enzymes responsible for browning reaction. Dehydrated green pepper after reconstitution in water resembles freshly harvested green pepper. Canned green pepper Green pepper after harvest is preserved in two per cent brine solution and the product is heat sterilized. Oil can also be distilled from white pepper but high price of white pepper and low oil yield do not favour its commercial production. Harvesting and curing Time of harvest depends upon variety and usually extends from January to March. Harvest early varieties at 7-8 months, medium varieties at 8-9 months and long duration varieties at 9-10 months after planting. Improved method of processing Cleaning: Harvested turmeric rhizomes are cleaned off mud and other extraneous materials adhering to them and subjected to curing within 2-3 days after harvest so as to ensure the quality of the end product. Oleoresin yield ranges from 7. Propagation by seedlings Selection of mother trees: Locate mother trees that give a steady annual yield with a mean fruit weight of 200-275 g, high acid and low tannin content. Collect seeds from freshly harvested and fully ripe fruits and wash in running water and spread in a thin layer under roof. Soft wood grafting Select scions only from specific elite trees regular in bearing, which produce high yield of large and quality fruits. Collection of scion: Select straight growing, healthy, young shoots emerging from the primary branches with whorled leaf arrangement. Both the adult beetles and their grubs defoliate the crop inflicting heavy loss of yield. This causes withering of leaves, drying up of branches and yield loss. Harvesting Seedlings start bearing generally at the age of 10-12 years. Harvest mature fruits manually before they fall. Immediately after harvest, wash the fruits in running water and separate the fruit rind for processing. Harvest and yield Seedlings start to yield 8-10 years after planting, whereas grafts and budded seedlings give yield after 4-5 years. Stabilized yield of 250 kg tree is obtained from 9-10 years onwards. Harvesting is done from January to April. Nursery techniques Sow selected seed nuts soon after harvest in nursery bed with stalk-end up and with a spacing of 5-6 cm. Note: Plant characters such as girth at the collar one year after transplanting and number of nodes two years after transplanting are highly correlated with yield. Removal of plants with poor collar girth and lesser number of nodes one and two years after planting respectively, will help to increase the yield potential of plantations. This is repeated till four months after planting when the crop is ready for harvest. Harvesting In about 3-6 months time, vines grow to a height 150-180 cm. Once harvesting is commenced, it is continued almost every day or week. The interval of harvesting varies from 15 days to about a month till the next lowering of vines. After each harvest, manuring has to be done. The leaves should be harvested only after 15 days of insecticide application. All these clones are tolerant to vascular streak dieback and have yield potential in the range from 55 to 180 pods per tree per year and mean yield from 38 to 78 pods per tree per year. These hybrids have mean yields of 90, 105, 79,114,138, 99, 120 and 86 pods per tree per year respectively. Therefore growing of different varieties adjacent to each other must be encouraged so as to achieve maximum fruit set and yield realization. If seeds cannot be procured from such seed gardens, mother plants for collection of seeds may be selected based on the following criteria: 1. Yield of pods should be not less than 100 per year. Seeds lose viability within a week of harvest of pods. Scions for budding are to be collected from high yielding, disease resistant elite plants. This type of growth causes difficulties in carrying out cultural operations and harvesting. N:P2O5:K2O may be applied   200:80:280 g   plant   year, in trees yielding more than 60 fruits per year. Top working This technique is useful to rejuvenate old and unproductive cocoa plants and also to convert genetically poor yielders to high yielders. Patch budding as described earlier may be done on three to four vigorous and healthy shoots using scions from high yielding, disease resistant clones and the remaining chupons are removed. Because of the presence of an established root system and the trunk with reserve food, the top worked trees grow much faster and give prolific yield one year after the operation. Top worked trees start yielding heavily from the second year onwards. About 50 per cent improved yield is obtained in the second year and about 100 per cent improved yield in the third year. The main stem will continue to belong to the older plant and fruits borne on this area belong to the poor yielder. Better yields are however obtained from the fan branches of the high yielding clone used for top working. Management Harvest the crop just when bronzing is visible in the pod furrows. Harvesting It takes about 170 days for a cocoa pod to develop from formation to maturity. Pods remain suitable for harvesting for fairly long time after they have ripened. Hence, it is possible to have harvest of sufficient number of pods at a time by either delaying the harvest of early ripened pods or harvest of pods, which are fully ripened. Harvesting should be done at regular intervals rather than daily, once in 7-10 days. The discards at the harvest can be left in the garden either in the open during summer or in pits at different sites in the rainy season or they can be incorporated in the compost. During the period between harvesting and splitting, pre-fermentation activity inside the pod is hastened, which improves later fermentation. From the selected and certified seed blocks, healthy and fully matured fruits of normal appearance with three quarters of ripening are harvested selectively from the marked plants during November-December in the case of arabicas and in January- February in robustas. Arabica selections of tall, medium and dwarf habit are grown on large scale because of their proven performance in yield and comparatively better resistance to leaf rust disease. The vertical (orthotropic) shoots are marked after harvest is over in any selected plant.

Drought management in coffee Plants affected by drought limit vegetative growth, show floral abnormalities and poor fruit set resulting in reduced yield. Following growth regulators could increase the yield when they are given as foliar application 10-15 days after blossom (first spray) and during last week of May before the onset of southwest monsoon (second spray). By this, ripening can be hastened by 2-4 weeks and in two rounds about COFFEE 172 96 per cent ripe fruits could be harvested. Timely and complete harvest, collection of gleanings, burying the infested berries and maintaining optimum shade and good drainage can control the pest. Timely   clean harvest using picking mat and phytosanitary measures like removal of left over berries on the plant and gleanings (berries fallen on the ground) are the most effective measures to contain the CBB. Early high yield, better soil conservation, less weed growth, efficient cultural practices and better supervision are other advantages of double hedge planting. of kg ha annum splits 1st year 180:270 5 2nd year 240:360 6 3rd year 340:450 6 4th year   above 300:300 6 mature tea varies with yield and soil test values while the N:K2O ratio varies with the stage of pruning. The seeds should be sown within six months after collection. Harvest two to three leaves and a bud and   single and two-leaf banjis. Shear-harvest during rush periods. Harvesting Harvesting is done either by removing the mature leaves or by cutting the stalk when maximum leaves are matured. The harvested leaves are cured for the purpose for which the produce is meant. Spraying 1 per cent urea immediately after each harvest will increase the yield. Varieties Priya, Preethi, Priyanka and Arka Harit are high yielding varieties.

Summer : March-April Autumn : August-December Spring : January-February Varieties Among the high yielding varieties, Kufri Jyothi (early), Kufri Muthu (medium) and Kufri Dewa (late) can be tried in the high ranges of Kerala. Open sunlight is essential for good yield. Irrigation should be withheld one week before harvest. Harvesting The crop will be ready for harvest by 3. Average yield of bulbs is 6-8 t ha-1. The cloves for planting should be stored for 2-3 months after harvest and cloves weighing 4 g are ideal for planting. Harvest Harvesting can be done 120-130 DAP. Yield may vary from 5-10 t ha-1. Average yield is 6-10 t ha-1. Average yield is 10-15 t ha-1. Average yield is 5 to 6 t ha-1. Average yield is 10-15 kg per plant. Average yield is 5-6 t ha-1. Stem cuttings with three or four nodes and 30-40 cm length, selected from high yielding female vines are used as planting material. The average yield is 10-15 t ha-1. Average yield is 10 to 15 t ha-1. The average yield is 12-15 t ha-1. The average yield is 10-15 kg per tree per year. To check the height of the plant and to get frequent harvests, the tips are clipped off intermittently. The average yield is 2   5 kg per m2 per year. The average yield is 1-2. The average yield is 2. The average yield is 2-2. Scientific roguing (removal of off-types at nursery stage, vegetative phase, flowering, fruiting and harvest stages) should be practiced. In general, for most vegetable crops, taking one or two vegetable harvests is found ideal for economic seed production. Harvest the crop at optimum fruit maturity, since immature and over mature fruits affect the seed quality. Fruits of 45-50 days maturity may be harvested for seed extraction in the case of Jwalasakhi and Ujwala. It is economical to take two vegetable harvests and then retain the crop for seed production. Fruits of 36 days maturity may be harvested for seed extraction in the case of Arka Anamika. 205 TIPS FOR VEGETABLE SEED PRODUCTION Bitter gourd Taking two vegetable harvests and then leaving the crop for seed production is economical. Fruits of Preethi variety should be harvested 21-24 days after anthesis to get maximum recovery of good quality seeds. Ripe fruits of 24 days maturity in Preethi, when the whole fruits turn to bright orange colour, can be harvested for seed extraction. Snake gourd Fruits can be harvested for seed extraction 36 days after anthesis (Harithasree), when yellowing of fruits start from the stylar end. Oriental pickling melon Harvest fully ripe fruits with deep orange colour (30 days after anthesis in Mudicode), when the vines wither. It is advisable to have a post-harvest storage of fruits for three months to get higher germination. Vegetable cowpea Dried pods can be harvested for seed purpose. Amaranth It is economical to take one vegetable harvest at 30 days after planting and then leaving the crop for seed production. Growth and yield characteristics of popular banana Nendran varieties are given in Table 32. Growth and yield characters of Nendran Clonal name Plant Pseudostem No. Plant crop followed by two ratoon crops gives maximum yield. For ratoon crop, the entire fertilizers have to be applied in a single dose immediately after the harvest of the preceding crop. Nendran (October planting) grown under deep water table conditions (below 2 m from ground level) needs 10 mm (40 l plant) irrigation once in two days during summer season to ensure higher bunch yield and better water use efficiency. 5 kg paddy straw (waste quality) will considerably improve the bunch yield. For vegetable purpose, cucumber may be harvested within 95 days and for seed purpose the duration may be about 130 days. Pre harvest bunch spray Pre harvest bunch sprays of 3 per cent K2SO4 (3 g in 100 ml of distilled water) twice, the first two weeks after bunch emergence and the second four weeks after bunch emergence increases the fruit yield substantially and consumer preferences in Nendran banana. Destroy the parts of rhizome and pseudostem of harvested plants in the field as described above. Under severe conditions, necrosis and death of cigar leaf is noticed and such plants fail to flower and lead to total yield loss. Yield Guava layers start bearing from 3-4 years after planting. However, a high yielding larger fruited variety was located from the rain shadow region of the Western Ghats and popularized as  Chambakad Large. Harvesting Seedlings will commence bearing from the 10 th year and the grafts in 3-4 years. Yield ranges between 30-50 kg per tree per year when full grown. A tree may yield as many as 250 fruits. Harvesting The seedlings generally bear after eight years and the grafted plants after three years of planting. The average yield from one tree is about 50-100 fruits per year. Induction of flowering and improvement of yield in adult mango trees (  15 years old) Apply Paclobutrazol   5. Fruit flies can be effectively managed by keeping Ocimum trap   4 tree and collection and destruction of fallen fruits by taking deep pits having at least 60 cm depth, setting up of Pheromone trap (methyl eugenol trap)   1trap per 15 cents, swabing the tree trunk with jaggery 10  containing malathion 0. bassiana formulation   10 litre solution   40m2 under tree canopy (containing 20 g formulation litre) during fruiting season and post harvest treatment of harvested fruits with luke warm water (48oC) containing 1  salt for 15 minutes is recommended. Harvesting The seedlings flower and set fruit within 3-5 months after transplanting. The number of fruits harvested per tree per year varies from 25 to 30. Fruits showing streaks of yellow colour are harvested. Fruits will be ready for harvest by 5 ¼ - 5 ¾ months after the application of growth regulator. Bigger suckers give early yield. Irrigation Wherever irrigation facilities are available, providing irrigation in summer months at two weeks intervals results in good fruit size and high yield. If there is no irrigation facility, the crop should be scheduled for harvest before summer months (before March). Fruits will be ready for harvest by 130-135 days after the application of growth regulator. Harvest over different months   seasons could be obtained by carefully phasing   planning the planting and growth regulator application. Ratoon cropping The plant crop after harvest can be retained as ratoon crop for two more years. After the harvest of the plant crop, chopping the side leaves of the mother plant should be done for easy cultural operations. Harvesting Mature fruits, which are dull brown in colour, are harvested and stored for about five days before they are fully ripened for consumption. Flowering, fruiting and harvesting Rooted cuttings and layers flower in six months. The harvest of fruits commences from August and continues up to November. Rarely, flowering is noticed in March and the crop comes to harvest in April   May. Yield The average yield during fourth year is 2 kg per plant. Harvesting Much of the success in apple production depends on proper picking, storage and disposal. The harvested fruits may be stored for 120-150 days at 4-5oC, provided there is good circulation of air. It is preferable to grow anthurium in the open, under artificial shade structures for better growth and yield. Harvesting The flowers are harvested with its long stem when 1 4th to 3 4th flowers on the spadix are open, indicated by the change of colour. Harvesting The spikes are harvested before the opening of all the buds of the spike, depending on the genus. They give good yield in low rainfall conditions. Irrigation Constant and adequate water supply during peak flowering season (March-Octo- ber) is essential for high yield of flowers. Yield Yield of flowers and jasmine oil vary according to the species and management practices as presented below. Species Flower Oil yield yield (t ha-1) (kg ha-1) J. Harvesting and yield The plant starts flowering in 2-3 months after planting based on the variety. After harvest of flowers, the plants are left undisturbed in the field. When they start yellowing, the plants are uprooted for harvest of corms and cormels. Ratoon crop After the harvest of the main crop, the flower stalks are headed back and the plot is manured and irrigated. Harvest and yield Tuberose is harvested by cutting the spikes from the base for table decoration or the individual flower is picked from the spike for making garlands and other floral ornaments: The average yield of flower is as follows: Plant crop: 5-10 t ha-1 First ratoon: 9-12 t ha-1 Second ratoon: 4-6 t ha-1 have four or five pairs of leaves. Harvest and yield Crossandra flowers within two to three months after planting and continues to bear flowers throughout the year with a lean production season during rainy months. Harvesting of flowers is to be done on alternate days. The yield of flowers is about 5 t ha-1. Pinching is done to increase the total yield. Harvest and yield Marigold flowers will be ready for harvest in about 21 2 months time from the date of transplanting. The flowers are harvested when they have attained full size. Harvest the flowers in the evening along with a portion of stalk. Yield of French marigold will be 8-12 t ha-1 and that of African marigold 11-18 t ha-1. Harvest and yield China aster blossoms will be ready for harvest within 10-12 weeks of transplanting. Generally the entire plant is harvested when most of the flowers in the plant are opened and made into bundles of 10-12 each. The yield will be 10-12 t ha-1. However, application of 400 g ammonium sulphate, 60 g superphosphate and 25 g muriate of potash per plant per year during August from third year onwards is found to be useful in increasing leaf yield. Harvest and curing Pruning of side branches may be started from second year onwards. Varieties Rajani and Kasthuri are high yielding varieties with an yield potential of more than 2 tonnes dry rhizomes per ha and have good aroma and flavour. Harvesting and curing The crop can be harvested seven months after planting. Drying of the leaves is the indication of crop maturity for harvest. Harvest the crop carefully without damaging the rhizomes, remove dried leaves and roots, wash the rhizome in water and dry. The crop provides maximum yield from the second to fourth year of planting and economic yield up to the sixth year. Thereafter, the yield declines considerably. The leaves yield an aromatic oil, containing 70-90 per cent citral. Transplanted crop is found superior to direct-sown crop in respect of grass yield, oil content and citral content in oil. Application of nitrogenous fertilizers   100 kg ha-1 in four splits (each after 1st to 4th harvest) has been found to increase oil yield considerably. Harvesting Harvesting is done by cutting the grass 10 cm above ground level. The harvesting season begins in May and continues till the end of January. The first harvest is taken about 90 days after planting and subsequent harvests at intervals of 40-50 days. The optimum interval between harvests to obtain maximum quantity of oil is 40-45 days for local types of lemon grass. Seed collection The crop for seed production is left without cutting to get maximum seeds. Harvesting By about 3. It can be stored up to 3 days under shade without any adverse effect on yield or quality of oil. Yield The grass yield during the first year will be about 10 t ha-1, which gives about 28 kg of oil. From the second year onwards, the grass yield will be about 25 t ha-1 giving about 75 kg of oil. South Indian types produce higher root and oil yield, but North Indian types have superior oil quality. Among the South Indian types, the Nilambur type (ODV-3) on an average produces 5 t ha-1 of root, yielding 20-30 kg oil ha-1. 5 kg each of P2O5 and K2O per ha is found to be beneficial for increasing root and oil yield. Harvesting and distillation The optimum period of harvest of roots to get the maximum oil yield is 18 months. Harvesting is done with the digging forks. Harvesting The crop can be harvested in about 12-18 months after planting. Harvesting Plants start flowering 2-3 months after sowing. Harvesting is done by cutting the plants at this time, at a height of about 20 cm from ground level. Irrigate plants after harvest. Subsequent harvests can be made at 1. Seed collection A few plants per plot are left without cutting to set seeds. Ripe pods are to be harvested in the early morning to prevent loss of seeds by shattering during harvest. Harvesting and yield The crop matures in 7-8 months. The average yield is 12-15 t ha-1. Harvesting and yield The crop matures in 7 months. The average yield of fresh rhizome is 28 t ha-1 which on drying gives 27 per cent recovery. Processing The rhizome is thinly sliced and steam distilled for 3-4 hours for extracting the essential oil and the yield is 90 litres per ha. Harvesting and yield Though the crop can be harvested after 18 months, the optimum stage of harvest for obtaining maximum rhizome and oil yield is 36-42 months after planting. Harvesting is very arduous due to strong and extensive root ramification. The average yield of rhizomes is about 23 t ha-1, which on drying gives 25 per cent recovery. It is a shade loving plant and its growth, yield and quality are optimum under 25 percent shade. Fertilizer application Apply fertilizers at 10:8:5 kg N, P205 and K2O ha-1 for maximizing nutrient use efficiency and realizing highest yield of quality rhizome. As the rhizome development is upward regular earthing up is required for high yield. Harvesting and Yield Production of secondary rhizomes starts from fourth month. It is a shade loving plant and prefers 50 -75  shade for better growth, yield and quality. Remove the weeds as and when they come harvested for rhizome. Harvesting is done by digging out the rhizomes. Fresh rhizome yield is 3-4 t ha-1. The dried rhizome yield is 1-1. Higher yield is obtained if harvested during second year. Harvesting and yield After six months of planting, aerial parts start yellowing. Varieties Jeeva is a high yielding variety. It has purple colored stem with a yield of 4. Total yield from a bed is 6. Varieties Aswani-1 is an improved variety that give high bark yield. Harvesting and yield Flowering and fruiting occurs in November- December. Harvesting can be done one and half to two years after planting and it is better to harvest in January   February. Yield of dry tubers is about 1. Harvesting and yield Asoka can be cut after 20 years for collection of bark, the medicinally useful part. If irrigation and fertilizers are given the stump will produce new shoots and it can be harvested again after 5 years. Varieties Variety  Viswam  is recommended for higher spike yield both in irrigated open and shaded conditions. Plant protection For controlling nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita and Radopholus similis) apply Harvesting and yield Flowering is during March-April and fruiting during May-December. The yield is 50-75 kg dry seed per tree per year. Harvesting and curing Mature female spikes can be harvested seven months after planting. Black matured female spikes can be harvested at weekly intervals. The dry spike yield will be 1 5 th of the fresh weight of the spike. Harvesting The harvesting can be done from 7-8 years after planting. The crop can be harvested 2 years after planting. Harvesting The leaves can be collected one year after planting. The roots are harvested two years after planting and it is better to harvest in December- January. After the harvest the roots are washed in water, dried and can be stored in air tight steel containers upto five months without quality deterioration. Harvesting can be done 90 95 days after planting. Harvest the crop in a sunny day to increase the oil content of the plant. Keep the harvested produce in the field for 4-5 hrs to reduce the water content and weight of the produce. The mature leaves can be harvested from the bottom of the plants. After each harvest apply FYM along with earthing up. The harvesting of leaves can be done up to 3 years at 2 months interval. From second year onwards up to 10th year after planting the leaves can be harvested at regular intervals. The field is prepared by ploughing and ARROW ROOT, DANTAPPALA AND BRAHMI 258 KURUMTHOTTI (Sida alnifolia) Sida prefers open condition for maximum yield and quality. The optimum stage for harvesting is five months after planting. Harvesting is done by uprooting the whole plant and by cutting the plants. When harvested by cutting regrowth Optimum spacing : 50 x 25 cm. Optimum stage of harvest is 8 months after planting. Apply farmyard manure after each harvest. Subsequent harvests can be done at three months interval. The fresh form is marketed immediately after harvest. The harvested produce is washed and dried under shade. The crop is ready for harvest when it reaches 1. About six to seven harvests can be made in a year. From the second year onwards there is a slight increase in green fodder yield. The crop is ready for harvest by 9-10 weeks. At harvest, a stubble height of about 8 to 10 cm is left for good regeneration. Generally, about 25-40 t ha-1 of green fodder can be harvested per year under rainfed situation. Irrigated crop yields about 75-150 t ha-1 per year. Seed yields are low due to prolonged emergence of panicles, prolonged flowering of the same panicle, early shedding of spikelets, bird damage etc. In 1953, a cross was made in India with bajra which is more succulent, leafy, fine textured, palatable, fast growing and drought resistant than Napier to combine these qualities with its high yielding potential. Phenomenal yields are obtained from very deep fertile soil rich in organic matter. In order to encourage quicker regeneration from the basal buds, stubbles of 10-15 cm is left out at harvest. Green fodder yield ranges 200-250 t ha-1 per year from 6-8 cuttings. It can be mitigated if harvested at longer intervals (45 to 60 days). Topdressing N 40 kg ha-1 after each harvest is found to enhance the forage production. First harvest is done about three months after planting when the grass attains a height of about 60 to 75 cm. Annual yield of about 70 t ha-1 is obtained. It is a nutritious high yielding and palatable forage grass. Seed yields are generally low. The correct stage of harvest is soon after the end of anthesis. Germination is affected if the seed is harvested late. There is no post-harvest dormancy for seed. The first harvest can be done 50 days after planting and subsequently at 30-40 days interval. Rainfed crop yields about 35-45 t ha-1 of green fodder whereas the yield will be increased to about 50-100 t ha-1 under irrigated conditions. Average wood yield of 20 to 25 m3 per ha is commonly achieved. Subsequent harvests can be made at 50-60 days interval depending on the re-growth. In gravelly soil and in low rainfall areas, a yield of 25-30 tonnes per ha per year may be obtained. It is highly productive, yielding about 40 to 70 tonnes of green fodder per ha per year. Because of its pithy stem, the harvesting is easier. 267 SUBABUL, HEDGE LUCERNE AND AGATHI FODDER LEGUMES FODDER COWPEA (Vigna unguiculata) Cowpea is the most important leguminous fodder crop suitable for both summer and rainy seasons, mainly due to its quick growing habit and high yielding ability. When cut at 50 cm height at 60 days interval, green fodder yield of 12 tonnes per ha per year can be obtained. to get high yields. A single cut crop yields 25 to 30 t ha-1 whereas green matter yield of 40 t ha-1 is obtained from multi-cut cowpea. Apply phosphorus   120 kg and lime   375 kg per ha for maximum yield. A second weeding and hoeing may also be done after the first harvest. First harvest is taken 3-4 months after sowing and subsequent harvest at 45 days intervals or according to the growth of the crop. A maximum of 4-5 harvests can be taken in a year for a perennial crop, which will remain in the field for 3 years. The crop yields 25-30 t ha-1 green fodder per year. The green matter yield is 15-20 t ha-1. The green matter yield is 10-20 tonnes per ha. A green matter yield of 15 to 20 t ha-1 equivalent to 150-180 kg N ha-1 is obtained within a period of 8 to 10 weeks. The seed rate is 20-25 kg ha-1 and the green matter yield varies from 8 to 10 t ha-1. Better yield is obtained when two irrigations are given and when grown in clayey soil. 273 GREEN LEAF MANURE CROPS AILANTHUS OR MATTI (Ailanthus triphysa) Ailanthus trees flower in February-March and the fruit, a reddish brown samara, ripens in March-April, which represents the ideal time for seed collection. These include, collection of non-timber forest products from forests, growing trees around wetlands and other water bodies in which fish culture is practised, apiculture with trees and multipurpose woodlots etc. The trees can be felled harvested over a period of 8 to 10 years. Planting stock of high yielding disease resistant clones are available at the KFRI   Kerala Forest Department nurseries. Harvest Casuarina seedlings growing rapidly at the rate of about 1. 5 m per annum during the initial seven to eight years are usually harvested in about 7-10 years. Yield of high density fuel-wood plantations varies from 10-20 tonnes per ha per year on 7-10 years rotations. Higher yields are reported from irrigated and fertilized sites. In agroforestry situations, spacing within rows and between rows must consider the effect of shade and root competition on the yield of associated crops. The average wood yield per tree on a 15 years rotation is about 0. The ground must be cleared before hand by removing litter and other materials to facilitate seed collection. Termite feeding: Spread the teak fruits on the ground in a 5 cm layer immediately after collection. Planting and fertilization Spacing recommended for mono-specific 283 THORNY BAMBOO ROSEWOOD (Dalbergia latifolia) Rose wood is an important timber yielding tree of South India. Harvesting is done after 60-70 years. Permit is needed for its collection, retention or sale. It is good to sow seeds soon after collection as they are recalcitrant. Multipurpose tree species like ailanthus, teak, vellapine, silver oak and green manure yielding trees can be successfully interplanted in the older coconut plantation (preferably above 30 years of age), often in association with other field crops including medicinal plants such as kacholam. That is to say that any agro-ecological unit is a collection of panchayats. On an average, 6-8 tonnes of leaves will yield 4-5 tonnes of vermicompost with about 1. For large scale collection of vermiwash, a cement tank of size 80 cm x 80 cm x 80 cm with a side tap is constructed. This is essential to ensure better plant growth and yield. They are good honey gatherers with an average yield of 50-80 kg per colony. They are poor honey yielders and yield about 200   900 g of honey per colony. Indian bee (Apis cerana indica): They are the domesticated species, which construct multiple parallel combs with an average honey yield of 6-8 kg per colony per year. They yield 300-400 g of honey per year. It yields 8-10 kg of honey per colony per year. Maintaining bee colonies in orchards will increase the yield, since pollination is more efficient in such orchards. Only ripe honey is harvested when two-third of the comb cells are capped so that honey contains less than 20 per cent moisture. Planting material The variety K2 gives higher yield and better quality leaves. First harvest can be taken six months after planting by leaf picking. Second dose of 50 kg N per ha should be applied 8 weeks after the first leaf harvest. Collection and destruction of egg SERICULTURE 324 325 SERICULTURE masses and spraying 1 per cent DDVP are effective. Collection and destruction of egg masses, deep ploughing and flood irrigation to kill the pupae and application of 0. Yield Rainfed crop : 12000-15000 kg ha year Irrigated crop : 25000-30000 kg ha year Silkworm rearing Requirements for silkworm rearing 1. Cocoon should be harvested on the fifth and sixth day after mounting. The cocoon should be marketed immediately after harvest, so as to avoid adult emergence. Under average conditions, 100 dfls of bivoltine will yield 40-60 kg cocoons and cross breed will yield 30-50 kg cocoons. The damage starts at the time of planting and continues up to harvest. When collection of weevil is not possible, about one kg of infested salvinia can be used as the inoculum. The weed infestation affects the growth and vigour of the tree crops resulting in yield decline and gradual death of the trees. This is mainly evident as increase in plant height, number of leaves, better root formation, increased root nodulation in legumes and yield. On an average, it takes eight days from spawning to harvest. Yield potential is 800 g per kg straw. Bheema : High yielding white milky mushroom. For getting maximum yield, 2-2. Cropping and yield Matured and fully opened sporocarps are harvested by placing the thumb and forefinger near the base of the fruiting body and twisted in clockwise direction to get it detached from the mycelium. An average yield of 500-700 g can be harvested from 1 kg of straw. Harvest the mature sporocarps in egg stage. About 2-3 kg of mushrooms can be harvested from 10 kg of straw. After the harvest, the spent straw can be sun-dried and used as cattle feed. IMPROVING THE KEEPING QUALITY OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES About 30 to 40 per cent of the harvested fruits and vegetables are estimated to be lost due to improper harvesting, handling, storage and transportation in India. Harvesting a. Harvesting must be done at the appropriate maturity depending up on the marketing distances and purpose. Harvesting must be done preferably in the morning hours or late evening to avoid exposure of the produce to excessive heat, which will hasten spoilage. Harvesting must be done preferably with proper harvesting devices suited to the commodity. For example, mango harvesters with cutting edges and plastic net can prevent the damage during harvest and collection. Avoid impact shock while harvesting fruits from tall trees; eg. Avoid too loose or too tight packing in gunny bags while transporting harvested produces to minimize bruising. Wash the harvested produce in plain water or in chlorinated water to clean it of the adhering mud, dirt and residual pesticides. This can be done at farmer s level or at collection points to suit the standards established by individuals, industry or government. Pre-cool the commodity immediately after harvest to reduce the field heat. Using evaporative cool chamber constructed to store temporarily the harvested produce at the field before marketing. LOW COST TECHNOLOGY FOR IRRIGATION AND PROTECTED CULTIVATION Magnetic treatment of irrigation water The results indicated the beneficial effect of irrigation water treated with ceramic magnets on growth and yield of Cowpea, Brinjal and Bhindi crops under drip irrigation. Seventeen and 25  higher yield were reported for magnetically treated saline water (2000 ppm) and normal water respectively. Crop yield under the naturally ventilated greengouse is generally 3. 55 FARM MACHINERY SUITABLE FOR KERALA 344 It harvests broadcasted or transplanted non- lodged paddy. 18 ha h and has saving of 85 per cent labour and 65 per cent cost in harvesting paddy.

The land used for seed production should be free from volunteer plants of other varieties grown previously. As far as possible, fertile lands with irrigation and drainage facilities should be selected for raising the nurseries. Such lands should be suitably located to receive full sunlight. Plough and harrow the fields two or three times until the soil is thoroughly puddled and levelled. 0 kgm-2 of the nursery bed and mix well with the soil at the time of preparation of the field. Flooding the soil with too much water for long periods produces tall and weak seedlings, which do not readily recover during transplanting. Apply compost or cattle manure at the rate of 1 kg m2 of the nursery bed and mix well with the soil at the time of preparation of the field. Sow the seeds treated as described under dry seed treatment method evenly over the bed and cover with fine sand or soil. Irrigate seed beds a day before pulling out the seedlings to soften the soil and to facilitate washing of roots. Wash off mud and soil from the roots carefully and tie the seedlings into bundles of convenient size for transplanting. Preparation of land General Plough the field thoroughly to incorporate the weeds and straw into the soil. Apply fertilizers on the drained soil at the time of final ploughing and levelling and thoroughly mix into the soil. Maintain a thin film of water to facilitate sowing so that the germinated seeds do not get covered with clayey soil, which affects seedling establishment. In Kari soils, avoid cracking of soils by prolonged drying since it will lead to severe acidity. Wherever the soil K status is medium to high based on soil test data and also where incorporation of straw is a practice and tidal contribution of the nutrient is significant. Phosphorus can be skipped for six seasons without any significant reduction in grain yield in riverine alluvium soils medium to high in available P.

Land is ploughed thoroughly and transplanting is done. For the second crop, land is prepared thoroughly and direct sowing of sprouted seeds or transplanting is done. Onattukara With the onset of pre-monsoon showers, land is ploughed thoroughly. When the soil in the field becomes dry, mounds of 1 m base and 0. When the soil and weather conditions become favourable for sowing, the baskets containing the seeds are re-soaked for 3 to 6 hours before sowing. Manuring Organic manuring Apply organic manure in the form of farmyard manure or compost or green leaf   5 t ha-1 and incorporate into the soil while ploughing. Green crop manuring Cowpea may be raised as an intercrop in dry seeded low land (semi-dry) rice by sowing 12. When the rice field gets submerged with the onset of south west monsoon, cowpea at the age of about six weeks and at active vegetative stage decays and gets self-incorporated in the soil adding substantial quantity of green manure. For modan cultivation (upland crop) and direct seeded crop in wet lands, apply nitrogen in three equal split doses, first as basal dressing, second at tillering stage (three weeks after seeding) and the third at panicle initiation stage (about thirty days before flowering). Apply the full dose of phosphorus at the time of land preparation as basal dressing. The general principle to be followed is that in light soils as well as in soils with high leaching, nitrogen may be applied in three or four split doses according to the duration of the variety.

In coarse sandy loam soils with high percolation as in Onattukara region, nitrogen and potash fertilizers may be applied in five equal splits at planting, 15th, 38th, 53rd and 70th day for medium duration varieties which coincide with the stages of early tillering, neck node differentiation, early reduction division and heading stages respectively in the case of medium duration varieties. For increasing the efficiency of urea for top dressing, mix urea with six times its weight of slightly moist soil and apply to the field 24- 28 hours after mixing. In Kari soils of Kuttanad, apply Dolomite   450Kg ha as two splits, half at the time of initial ploughing and half as top dressing one week prior to the application of fertilizers at the PI stage. The effect of zinc application can persist upto five years depending on the soil and cropping pattern. Hence soil application is not required for every season. Soil zinc status should be monitored before application to avoid accumulating toxic concentration of zinc. When the soil has less than 10 ppm of calcium chloride extractable sulphur or 15 ppm of phosphate extractable sulphur, substitute urea with ammonium phosphate sulphate to correct sulphur deficiency. For medium duration rice grown in brown hydromorphic soils ammonium phosphate sulphate may be used to supply 25 kg sulphur per hectare to protect the crop from sulphur deficiency (ad hoc recommendations). K status of soil is maintained by straw incorporation. After straw incorporation, if soil analysis prior to cropping season indicates low K status, K should be applied   15 kg K2O ha -1. Application of magnesium as basal dose in the form of magnesium sulphate (16 per cent MgO) or magnesite (40 per cent MgO) or dolomite (10 per cent MgO)   20 kg MgO ha is effective in giving a significant increase in grain and straw yield of rice in magnesium deficient soils. In non- deficient soils, a marginal increase in grain and straw yield is also obtained. In iron toxic laterite soils of Kerala, application of 120 kg potash ha-1   lime 150 kg ha-1   silica 100 kg ha-1 (as sodium silicate 250 kg ha-1 or fine silica 100 kg ha-1 or rice husk ash 500 kg ha-1) is recommended for higher yields. Dry seeded rice  upland and lowland (semi-dry) rice  Sl. Stale seed bed technique: After land preparation, withhold sowing and allow the weedy rice seeds in the top layers of the soil to germinate. In fields with very severe infestation, skip the crop for one season and go for repeated stale seed bed operations to exhaust the soil seed bank of weedy rice. Pre sowing herbicide application to prevent the establishment of weedy rice seedlings After land preparation, drain the field to retain only a thin film of water. Management of Salvinia molesta (African payal) Trampling salvinia in situ in the wet lands a week before transplanting will control the weed and add to soil fertility. If the inherent soil N is low, basal N   25-30 kg ha-1 is to be applied. Prophylactic application of talc based formulation of Trichoderma viride as - Seed treatment (10 g kg-1 seed)   Soil application (2. 5 kg ha-1 ) one week after transplanting   Foliar spray (10g l-1) after one month is effective for the management of sheath blight for upland rice. Prophylactic application of talc based formulation Pseudomonas fluorescens as - Seed treatment (10 g kg-1 seed)   Soil application (2. Adopt agronomic practices for increasing fertilizer use efficiency such as: (a) Incorporating ammoniacal N in the reduced zone in the soil (b) Incubating urea with moist soil (1:6) for 24 hours (c) Blending urea with neem cake. Cow dung powder may be incorporated   one third volume of the puddled soil and spread over the sheet at a thickness of 10-15 mm. Sprinkle water over the seedbed for four days twice daily and keep soil in saturated condition. Final preparation may be done on the day of transplanting in case of sandy loam soil, but may be done 3-4 days prior to planting in case of clayey soils, depending upon settling time of the puddle to consolidate.

Seeds and sowing Seed rate Pure crop 20-25 kg ha-1 Mixed crop 6 kg ha-1 Sowing Plough the land 2-3 times thoroughly and remove weeds and stubbles. Well-drained loamy and laterite soils are suitable. Land Preparation The land should be prepared thoroughly by ploughing, digging and removing all stems, stubbles, etc. 49 GREEN GRAM AND GREEN PEA HORSE GRAM (Macrotyloma uniflorum) Horse gram can be grown in paddy nurseries after transplantation of the second crop and in palliyal lands after harvest of first crop and uplands during rabi season. Season: September-October Variety: Co-1 and Pattambi Local AK-21 and AK- 42 (Photo insensitive varieties) Seeds and sowing Seed rate: 25-30 kg ha-1 Sowing After land preparation, sow the seeds either dibbled in rows 25 cm apart or by broadcast. Red gram can be grown in almost all soil types that are not very poor in lime and are not subjected to waterlogging. Optimum growth and yield are obtained in deep loam soils. In soils of medium fertility, top dressing of nitrogen   30 kg ha-1 four weeks after sowing is essential. Land Preparation As waterlogging will affect germination and growth of the crop, it may be sown in raised beds during rainy season. In soils of low fertility, application of organic manures is beneficial. The disease occurs in patches under high soil moisture and high organic matter levels. A well-drained soil of medium texture is suited for this crop. Land Preparation Dig pits of 60 cm x 60 cm x 45 cm size 90 cm apart. Collect the topsoil to a depth of 15-20 cm separately and fill it after the pits are formed. 5 kg pit and mix with topsoil. It can be grown on a wide variety of soils except hard clay or pure sands, but requires a deep well drained, fertile loamy soil, preferably with a pH of 5. 5 with a mean soil temperature above 20oC. Land preparation The land is usually made to a fine tilth and ploughed to a depth of 20-40 cm followed by the formation of ridges and furrows especially in heavy textured soils. Manuring Soil amendment (dolomite), cattle manure and NPK  1 ton ha-1, 25 tons ha-1 and 80:50:150 kg ha-1 respectively is recommended for cultivation. Apply dolomite during first land preparation alteast 15 days before planting. Irrigation During summer and drought periods, it is essential to give 5-6 shallow irrigations to maintain soil moisture. Maintenance of adequate soil moisture, proper shade to sustain a humid microclimate and avoiding full exposure to sunlight is a must for good crop growth, better tuber and leaf yield. Nutritional disorders When the crop is grown in laterite soils of Kerala, interveinal chlorosis of the lower leaves characteristic to Mg deficiency was prevalent from 3rd month of growth causing complete devastation of crop. As tannia is identified as an indicator plant for Mg deficiency, application of dolomite   1 ton per ha during land preparation is advocated to prevent the problem in these soils. They can also be stored by embedding in dry soil or sand for a period of 4-5 months under ventilated, dry and semi dark conditions. Well- drained soil is suitable for uniform development of tubers. Land preparation Plough or dig the land to a depth of 20-25 cm and bring to a fine tilth. Irrigation Ensure sufficient moisture in the soil at the time of planting. Subsequent irrigation may be given at 12-15 days intervals, depending on the moisture retention capacity of the soil. Yam requires loose, deep, well-drained, fertile soil. Indu : This is recommended as a pure crop and also as an intercrop of coconut in the reclaimed alluvial soils of Kuttanad. About 2500-3000 kg of seed material is required to cover one hectare of land. 57 COLOCASIA AND DIOSCOREA DIOSCOREA AND LESSER YAM 58 Preparation of land Plough or dig the land up to a depth of 15- 20 cm. 25 kg cattle manure or compost and mix with top soil. Plant the cut tuber pieces and completely cover the pit with leafy materials to conserve soil moisture and maintain optimum temperature. Plant the whole tuber, one in each mound and cover completely with soil. Preparation of land Plough or dig the land to a depth of 15-20 cm.

Plant the vine cuttings with the middle portion buried deep in the soil and the two cut ends exposed to the surface. The crop can be grown on a variety of soils having good drainage, but grows best in fertile sandy loam soils. Heavy clayey and very light sandy soils are not suitable for proper tuber development. Season Rainfed crop: June-July, September- October Irrigated crops: October-November (for uplands) and January- February (for low lands) Varieties Improved varieties: H-41, H-42, Sree Nandini, Sree Vardhini, Sree Rethna, Sree Bhadra, Kanjanghad, Sree Arun, Sree Varun and Sree Kanaka. the soil for early establishment of the cutting. Land preparation Make the soil to a fine tilth by ploughing or digging to a depth of 15-25 cm. For the reclaimed alluvial soils of Kuttanad, the recommendation is 50:25:50 kg ha-1. Under rainfed conditions, green manure crops such as kozhinjil and sunnhemp can be grown after harvest of the sweet potato and later incorporated into the soil at the time of land preparation for the succeeding crop. The crop grows well in well-drained laterite, gravelly and sandy loam soils. Heavy and rocky soils are less suitable because they restrict root development. The crop can also be gown on hill slopes with precautions and on wastelands of low fertility. Kalpaka: This is a non-branching type with six months duration and is suited as an intercrop of coconut in reclaimed alluvial soils of Kuttanad. Pit, flat, ridge or mound method of planting can be adopted depending upon soil type, topography of land and elevation so that waterlogging is avoided. Land preparation Before planting, plough the field 2-3 times or dig to a depth 25-30 cm depending upon soil type to establish a deep porous field in which the setts are to be planted. Preparation of nursery: Select an area with well drained soil and irrigation facility. Mark out the length 63 TAPIOCA and breadth and make raised beds of soil : sand mixture in equal proportion. An area of 220 m2 nursery is required for producing minisetts for planting one hectare of land. Two node cuttings are planted end to end horizontally, about 5 cm deep inside the soil, with the buds facing either sides. 5 t ha-1 during the preparation of land or while filling up the pits so as to provide about 1 kg of organic manure per plant. Dose of P2O5 can be reduced to half where the crop is grown for more than 3 years under full dose of recommended fertilizers, since under such situation there would be build up of soil P. In the acid soils of Kerala, 50 per cent of K requirement can be substituted by NaCl. Soil application of Mg as MgSO4   20 kg ha-1 (1. When they are used continuously, their application rates can be fixed based on their status in the soil following Table 14. After cultivation Keep the field free of weeds and maintain soil loose by 2-3 shallow diggings or hoeing upto 90 days after planting followed by light earthing up. 5 months time to have enough canopy to cover the land. In acid laterite soils of Kerala, apply 1000 kg ha-1 of lime as basal dressing. , 40-45 days after sowing) the soil should not be disturbed, as it will affect the pod development adversely. After the harvest of pods, the haulms are incorporated in the soil along with a top dressing of 50 kg each of N and K2O per ha for the main crop. 5 Soil Mg status Soil Zn status Table 14. Application rate of Mg and Zn based on their status in the soil Plant protection Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) The disease is transmitted by a white fly Bemisia sp. Production of disease free planting material of tapioca through nursery techniques Setts of 3 to 4 node cuttings from apparently disease free plants are collected and planted in the nursery at a very close spacing of 4 x 4 cm so that about 500 setts can be accommodated in one square metre land. A well-drained medium fertile soil is suitable for its cultivation. Preparation of main field Plough or dig the land to a depth of 15-20 cm and form ridges 30 cm apart or raised beds of 60-90 cm width. Manuring Broadcast 10 tonnes of FYM and N:P2O5: K2O   30:60:50 kg ha-1 and incorporate into the soil at the time of land preparation. Cover a portion of the vine with soil to promote tuber formation. It can be grown in almost all types of soils from sandy to laterite and up to an elevation of 600-700 m including wastelands of low fertility. Heavy clay soils, poor drainage conditions, very low temperature and frost are unsuitable for the crop. Use polythene bags of size 20 cm x 15 cm and fill the bags with garden soil, leaving a gap of 1 to 1. Sow the pre-soaked seed nuts in polythene bags filled with garden soil at a depth of 2-3 cm with the stalk end up. Prepare the potting mixture (1:1:1 ratio of red soil, river sand and compost) mixed with rock phosphate   5 g per 2 kg potting mixture. The pits are filled with topsoil and 5-10 kg of compost or dried cowdung   pit and the grafts are planted after carefully removing the polythene bags. 5 m for poor and 10 m for rich and deep soils and sandy coastal area. On very sloppy lands, the rows may be spaced 10-15 m apart with a spacing of 6-8 m between trees in a row. If the soil is very rich the canopy development rate will be faster. High density planting would be more useful in poor soils where the rate of canopy expansion is slow. Considering the fertility status of the soil, the level of management in terms of fertilization, irrigation etc. 2 per cent   10 ml 1-1) and drench the pesticide solution onto the soil near the root zone to minimize reinfestation by the pest. It can be grown in a wide variety of soils. A deep homogeneous fertile soil is desirable. Preparation of land and sowing Plough the land three to four times and form ridges and furrows. Soils of the traditional belt are highly weathered and are mostly laterite and lateritic types. Red and alluvial soils are also found in some areas. Rubber grows in a wide range of soils however, deep well drained soils free from underlying sheet rocks are well suited for the cultivation of rubber. Subsequently, application of Zinc Sulphate in the nursery may be carried out on soil test basis. Seedling nursery Level lands with water table at least 60 cm below is ideal for raising seedling nursery. Soil should be deep, well drained loam with good fertility status. Mulching in between the plant rows reduces weed growth besides conserving soil moisture and regulating soil temperature. Polythene (LDPE HDPE) bags of 45 x 18 cm holding about 7 kg soil are generally used. Larger bags 55 x 25 cm which holds about 10 kg soil are preferred for raising larger plants (3 whorls or more). The bags should be filled with top soil. About 20 to 25 g rock phosphate is incorporated in the top half of the soil filled in the polybags. Partially dried elephant dung mixed with equal quantity of soil can also be used as an alternative to coir pith. Root trainers are stacked in a raised bed of soil so as to facilitate tap root development. Contour lining is done on undulating and hilly lands by marking out the planting points in contour lines across the slope. Soil and water conservation: Formation of terraces is a recommended practice in hilly areas to conserve soil and water. Drainage: Proper drainage is essential especially on low-lying lands. In soils with a depth of one meter or more, planting can be done in small pits dug to accommodate polybag plants. However in hard soils, planting should be done in larger pits of size 75 cm3 or 90 cm3 depending on hardness. While digging the pit, the top soil should be placed on one side and subsoil on the other. Filling should be done with top soil after removing stones and roots. Compost or well- rotted cattle manure   12 kg and rock phosphate 200 g are mixed with the top 20 cm soil in the pit. While planting budded stumps, the bud patch should be just above the ground level to reduce the effect of elephant foot and infection by soil-borne Table 19. After leveling the soil, the stump is placed in the hole with its tap root and lateral roots spread out in proper position so that the tip of the root is in contact with bottom soil and no air gap is left in between. The hole is then filled and the soil around the stump is packed firmly with the help of a crowbar. The bottom of the bag is cut and the bag along with the plant is placed in the hole, gradually filling the hole with the soil core intact. The soil is finally packed firmly around the plants. A planting hole can be made in the refilled planting pit by pressing the empty root trainer container into soil. The root plug is carefully inserted into the planting hole and the soil around is compacted. Mulching, shading, irrigation and whitewashing: The soil around the plants should be mulched properly before the onset of summer to conserve soil moisture, maintain optimum soil temperature and control weed growth. Cover crops: Cover crops are established and maintained in rubber plantation for conserving soil and improving or maintaining soil structure and fertility. Fast growing leguminous creepers, having the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen in addition to other attributes common to all cover plants like suppressing weed growth, reducing soil temperature etc. RUBBER 86 Intercropping Rubber is planted at a wide spacing and hence sufficient land and light are available in the inter-row areas during the initial years for intercropping. Intercrops should be selected based on slope of the land, light availability in the plantation and marketability. Intercrops should be selected based on the slope of the land. If the slope is more than 5 per cent, intercrops which require less soil disturbance should be selected. The fertilizer application to intercrops will affect soil nutrient status. Hence after intercropping, fertilizer application for rubber should be done based on soil testing to avoid nutrient imbalances. , coffee, cocoa and vanilla on Glyricidia standards can be cultivated as intercrops without adversely affecting growth and yield of rubber and soil fertility from the young phase onwards. However, these are subject to modifications for individual holdings based on soil and leaf nutrient status, soil type, age of the plantation, management practices followed, etc. Application of compost farm yard manure enhances growth of rubber and adds to fertility of soil. As zinc deficiency is commonly noticed especially in young rubber, zinc sulphate application   25 kg ha or 50g plant mixed with equal quantity of farm yard manure or top soil (for uniform distribution) two weeks after the post monsoon fertilizer application during the year of planting is advocated as an ad hoc recommendation. Time and frequency of fertilizer application Fertilizer should be applied when there is sufficient moisture in the soil. From second year onwards, the fertilizers should be applied in two equal splits during April-May (pre-monsoon) and September-October (post-monsoon) when there is enough moisture in the soil. For manure rubber also, fertilizers can be applied in two equal splits, first application after a period of about 30 days after the onset of pre-monsoon showers after ensuring the presence of prolific feeder roots in the surface soil and second application during September-October. Method of application During the first year, fertilizers should be evenly distributed over a circular band of 30 cm all around the base of young plant, leaving about 7 cm from the base and slightly forked into the top 5 to 8 cm of soil. Discriminatory fertilizer recommendation Fertilizer recommendation based on soil and leaf analysis ensures site-specific fertilizer application for rubber and is the most ideal approach. Sugarcane grows well on medium heavy soils, but can also be raised on lighter soils and heavy clays, provided there is adequate irrigation. The soils should be well drained. Varieties CoTI 1358 (Abhay): Tolerant to water logging CoTI 1153 (Aromal): Suitable for flood prone situations and have high sugar content suitable for jaggery production CO TI 88322 (Madhuri): Resistant to red rot disease Co 92175: Suitable for drought prone situation Co 740: For ratooning Co 6907, Co 7405 and Cul 57 84 (Thiru- madhuram): Red rot resistant, high sugar content Cul 527 85 (Madhurima): Resistant to red rot, tolerant to drought and waterlogging Co 88017 (Madhumathi): Resistant to red rot, tolerant to drought and waterlogging Preparation of land Plough the land thrice length-wise and breadth-wise and level properly. Planting Plant setts end to end in the furrow, with the eye buds facing sideways and cover with soil. 5 (Madhuri, Thirumadhuram, Madhurima and Madhumathi ) Chittoor area : 225:75:75 Newly cleared forest areas: 115:75:90 Apply organic manures such as compost  cattle manure pressmud as basal dose preferably in furrows and mix well with soil before planting. In sugarcane tracts of Palakkad where sett treatment with Azospirillum   500g ha-1 93 SUGARCANE together with soil application 5 kg ha-1 is done, sugarcane need be given only 175kg ha-1 N. Apply lime or dolomite or calcium carbonate in the field before final preparation of the land. In the black soil of Palakkad apply S at 60 kg ha-1 in the form of gypsum as a soil ameliorant before the final land preparation. The first dose is incorpo- rated into the soil by digging and the second dose is applied around the clump and earthing up is done. Coconut is grown in different soil types such as laterite, coastal sandy, alluvial and also in reclaimed soils of the marshy lowlands. The cultural practices have to be adopted to suit the varying climatic and soil conditions. 5 m depth) well drained soil. Avoid shallow soils with underlying hard rock, low-lying areas subject to water stagnation and heavy clayey soils. The nuts can also be stored in plots, provided the soil is sandy and the ground is sufficiently shaded. Selection and preparation of site for nursery Nursery sites should be well drained with light textured soil and with adequate but not too much shade. Method of planting seed nuts Plant the seed nuts in the beds in trenches 25-30 cm deep and cover with soil so that top 97 COCONUT portion of husk alone is visible. If the soil is sandy, provide mulching immediately after the cessation of monsoon rain. If termite is noticed, remove soil in the affected area upto a depth of about 15 cm and dust soil and nuts with carbaryl or chlorpyrifos. Never allow lifting the seedlings from the soil by pulling the leaves or stem. Preparation of land and planting of seedlings The nature of preparation of land before planting depends upon topography of land, soil type and other environmental factors. On slopes and in areas of undulating terrain, prepare the land by contour terracing or bunding. The size of pits for planting would depend upon soil types and water table. In loamy soils with low water table, pit size of 1m x 1m x 1 m is recommended. In laterite soils with underlying rock, take larger pits of size 1. In sandy soils, the size of pits may be 0. The pits may be filled up with top soil to a height 60 cm below the ground level. In low lying lands, take shallow pits and as the plant grows, raise the ground level by adding silt and sand so as to cover the entire bole of the palm. COCONUT 98 Note: In lateritic areas, common salt   2 kg per pit may be applied on the pit to improve soil conditions. Spacing Spacing depends upon the planting system, soil type etc. In general, spacings are recommended under different systems in sandy and laterite soils as given in Table 22. In lateritic gravelly soils, under rainfed conditions of north Kerala, a closer spacing to accommodate 250 palms per ha is more economical. In all types of soils that are low in organic matter content (except reclaimed clayey soils and alluvial soils), apply organic matter   of 15-25 kg per palm per year during June-July from the second year of planting. Remove the soil covering the collar of seedlings. Proper intercultivation provides control of weeds and creates soil mulch. Any tillage system (ploughing, digging, raking or forming mounds) that provides soil mulch and control weeds may be followed depending upon local conditions. For laterite, sandy and red sandy loam soils give two ploughings or diggings in May-June and September-October and one raking in January. Soil moisture is essential for the absorption of nutrients by roots. The husks are to be placed in layers with concave surface facing upwards and covered with soil. Mulching Mulching is an effective method of conserving soil moisture. For reclaimed clayey soils 0. Red loam soils (southern Kerala) 0. Mulching also adds organic matter to the soil and reduces the soil temperature. Do not disturb soil in the coconut garden during summer months. In level lands, during rainy seasons excess water may be conserved in small trenches dug out in the plantation. In sloppy areas, land may be terraced and trenches dug across. When a few plants start flowering, uproot the entire plants and incorporate into the soil during August- September and cover the basins with soil. The green manure crops should be ploughed in and incorporated into the soil during August-September. This will increase the water holding capacity of soil. The application of organic materials such as forest leaves, cattle manure, coir dust or coconut shredding at 10 kg per pit in the first three years and 15-25 kg thereafter will be useful to obtain better establishment of coconut palms in sandy soils and in coastal situations. In situations where the available P2O5 status of the soil is more than 10 ppm, application of phosphatic fertilizers can be skipped for a few years until the status of P2O5 reaches 10 ppm. In laterite soils, 50 per cent of the K2O requirement of coconut can be substituted by Na2O supplied in the form of sodium chloride. It ensures better land utilization, solar energy harvesting, efficient water use, utilization of soil nutrient resources, more returns and an insurance against crop failure. (Banana variety Palayankodan is recommended in the reclaimed soils of Kuttanad. Note: In coastal sandy soils, seawater can be used for irrigation.

Some of the major advantages of drip irrigation are: it saves water, enhances plant growth and yield, saves energy and labour, most suited for soils having low water holding capacity and undulating terrain, reduces weed growth and improves efficiency of fertilizers. The lower values are for sandy soils and higher values are for clayey soils. Intermediate values can be chosen based on the texture of the soil with values moving towards lower side for increasing sand content and vice versa for increasing clay content.

Magnesium may be supplied   500 g MgO per palm per year in the Onattukara region (sandy soil) and 100 g MgO in the remaining areas. Hence it may be preferred in acid soils. The ideal green manure crops for the sandy and alluvial soils are cowpea and sesbania, respectively. Apply hexaconazole   25 ml in 25 litre of water as soil drenching once in four months. Drench the basin with 40 litres of any copper fungicide to soak soil up to 15 cm depth at quarterly intervals. Avoid flood irrigation in order to prevent the possible spread of the pathogen through soil. The crop is grown best in sandy loam and loam soils. 5 t ha-1 Fertilizers N:P2O5:K2O 10:75:75 kg ha-1 Apply entire quantity of cattle manure or compost and recommended quantity of fertilizers as basal dressing and incorporate well into the soil. Apply lime at the time of flower- ing of the crop and mix with the soil by light hoeing or raking. Do not disturb the soil after 45 days of sowing. The oil palm grows on wide range of tropical soils. The adult palms can withstand occasional waterlogging, but frequently waterlogged, extremely sandy and hard lateritic soils should be avoided. The bags are filled with topsoil and compost and are arranged at a spacing of 45 cm x 45 cm and one sprouted seed is dibbled per bag. Supply of sufficient quantities of green leaf or compost is advantageous, especially where the soil is poor in organic matter. 115 OIL PALM Preparation of land and sowing Prepare the soil into a fine tilth by ploughing 2-4 times and breaking the clods. Work with harrow, followed by pressing with wooden plank so as to cover the seed in the soil. Cattle manure   compost: 5 t ha-1 N:P2O5:K2O: 30:15:30 kg ha-1 Apply cattle manure compost as basal dressing and incorporate into the soil along with last ploughing. Apply fertilizers as basal dose when there is enough moisture in the soil. SESAME (Sesamum indicum) Sesame grows in well-drained, sandy loam soils. Coarse sandy soils and soils of alkaline and saline nature are not suited for the crop. Season Lowland paddy field: December April (third crop) Uplands: August December Varieties For upland cultivation use varieties with long duration of 100-110 days and for low land, use varieties with duration of 80-99 days (Table 27).

Cardamom is generally grown in forest loam soils rich in available phosphorus and potassium. The crop is raised mainly on well drained, deep, good textured soils rich in humus. They are filled with equal quantity of humus rich topsoil, sand and cattle manure. When open areas like marshy valleys and grasslands are selected for raising new plantation, saplings of shade trees have to be raised before planting cardamom sucker. Spacing Mysore and Vazhukka: 2 m x 2 m to 3 m x 2 m depending on the fertility of the soil. 5 m to 2 m x 2 m depending on the fertility of the soil. The pits are filled with rich topsoil at least two months in advance of planting the seedlings. Application of well decomposed FYM or compost or leaf mould and 100 g of rock phosphate with the topsoil in the pit will help in proper establishment and quick growth of plants. A small pit may be formed inside the pit by scooping out soil at the centre of the pit for planting single tillers. The soil may be put just to cover the rhizomes. Care should be taken to ensure that the rhizomes do not go deep into the soil. Sufficient mulch should be applied at the base of the plant during December to reduce the ill effects of drought during summer months and to conserve soil moisture. Forking is necessary in hard soils, which is to be carried out in October- November. Soil conservation measures, maintenance of drainage channels and such other operations may be taken up promptly. The fertilizers may be applied in two split doses, before and after the southwest monsoon, in a circular band of 20 cm wide and 30-40 cm away from the base of the clumps and mixed with soil. The harvested capsules are washed in water to remove dust and soil particles. Early stages of the grub which are usually present in soil during May-June and September-October can be controlled by drenching chlorpyriphos 0. Well-drained, deep sandy soil, rich in humus is suitable for the crop. Fill the pit with leaf mould and topsoil before planting. Deep loam soils with high humus content and black loams of semi-forest regions with good drainage are fragments of quills of all grades are bulked and sold as quillings; (b) Featherings: This grade consists of the inner bark of twigs and twisted shoots that do not give straight quills of normal length. Prepare raised nursery beds with fertile soil rich in humus under the shade of trees. Fill up the pits with mixture of burnt earth, compost and topsoil. In such locations, it would be necessary to retain the natural shade provided by lofty trees and to leave the soil or the rich humus layer on the top undisturbed. Vanilla is cultivated on varied type of soils from sandy loam to laterites. Preparation of land Clear the land of jungle growth and prepare for planting. Manuring Being a surface rooting plant, manuring should be confined to the surface layer of soil. It prefers a rich soil with high humus content. The crop cannot withstand waterlogging and hence soils with good drainage are preferred for its cultivation. Remove diseased plants along with surrounding soil where the disease is observed. Drench soil around the base of vine with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture. VANILLA AND GINGER 130 Preparation of land Clear the field during February-March and burn the weeds, stubbles, roots etc. Prepare the land by ploughing or digging. Prepare beds of convenient length (across the slope where the land is undulating), 1 m width, 25 cm height with 40 cm spacing between the beds. Provide drainage channels, one for every 25 beds on flat lands. For the management of rhizome rot, bacterial wilt and fusarium yellows of ginger the following practices are recommended:   Soil application of Bleaching powder (15g)   lime (250g 3m2)   ATP, 2MAP, 4 MAP   Rhizome treatment with mancozeb (3 g l-1) for 30 min. Soil application of bleaching powder (15 g)   lime (250 g 3 m2 bed) -2 MAP   4 MAP   Seed treatment Soil application of Pseudomonoas fluorescens (2 )   cowdung supernatant (2 )-ATP, 2MAP, 4MAP   PGPM   Seed treatment soil appli- cation - ATP, 2MAP, 4MAP 4. After harvest, the fibrous roots attached to the rhizomes are trimmed off and soil is removed by washing. 133 GINGER AND MANGO GINGER MANGO GINGER (Curcuma amada) It is an under exploited spice crop, which grows luxuriantly in tropical soils with good drainage. The soil should be rich in organic matter and well drained. Preparation of land Prepare the land to a good tilth during February-March subject to the availability of pre-monsoon showers. If there is any delay in sowing, the seeds should be kept in baskets filled with damp soil. A mixture of garden soil and sand in the ratio 3:1 may be used for preparing nursery beds. The pits are filled with topsoil and compost or well decomposed cattle manure and seedlings are planted. Pepper prefers a light porous and well- drained soil rich in organic matter. Water stagnation in the soil, even for a very short period, is injurious for the plant. So, heavy textured soils in locations where drainage facilities are inadequate should be avoided. Select runner shoots produced at the base of mother plants and keep them coiled and raised to prevent from striking roots in the soil. The potting mixture is prepared by mixing two parts of fertile topsoil, one part of 137 BLACK PEPPER river sand and one part of well rotten cattle manure. The cuttings should be planted at least one node deep in the soil. Heavy watering, which makes the soil slushy and causes water logging is to be avoided. It reduces the incidence of soil born diseases and aids easy transportation of seedlings. The spacing recommended is 3 m x 3 m on plain lands and 2 m between plants in rows across the slope and 4 m between rows on sloppy lands. The soil should be pressed well around the standards to avoid air pockets and keep the standards firm in the soil. Fill the pits with a mixture of top soil and compost or well rotten cattle manure   5 kg per pit and 50 g of Trichoderma. Press the soil around the cuttings and form a small mound slopping outward and away from the cuttings to prevent water stagnation around the plants. Provide shade to the plants if the land is exposed and if there is a break in the rainfall. Management after planting If the terrain of the land is sloppy or uneven, carry out contour bunding or terracing to prevent soil erosion. PGPM soil application (50 g vine) and spraying (2 ) with consortium of PGPM helps to prevent phytophthora foot rot infestation. Apply cattle manure   compost   green leaves  10 kg  plant   annum just at the onset of southwest monsoon and cover lightly with soil. Apply fertilizers in a circle of radius 30 cm around the vine in the case of plants trailed on erythrina (Nadan murukku) or teak pole (dead standard) soil application of zinc   6 kg ha-1 as zinc sulphate or foliar spray of Zn   0. Application of molybdenum   1 kg ha-1 is recommended for areas deficient in soil molybdenum availability. Wherever water stagnation is a problem, effective drainage of both surface and sub-soil is to be ensured. To avoid soil splash and consequent disease initiation and spread, a legume cover in the plantation should be ensured. At the time of replanting, soil drenching with copper oxychloride should be given. VAM inoculum consisting of infected root bits and soils can be applied  100 cc per kg of potting mixture and Trichoderma   1g kg-1 of potting mixture. Pepper oleoresin Extraction of black pepper with organic solvents like acetone, ethanol or dichloro-ethane 145 BLACK PEPPER TURMERIC (Curcuma longa) Turmeric is a tropical herb and can be grown on different types of soil under irrigated and rainfed conditions. Rich loamy soils having good drainage are ideal for the crop. Preparation of land Prepare the land to a fine tilth during February-March. Plant finger rhizomes flat with buds facing upwards and cover with soil or dry powdered cattle manure. Manuring Apply cattle manure or compost as basal dose at 40 t ha-1 at the time of land preparation or by spreading over the beds after planting. The tree is very much adapted to hill tops and plain lands alike. It grows well in dry or occasionally waterlogged or flooded soils. If symptoms of early wilt or rhizome rot appear, drench the soil with cheshunt compound or 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture. Usually seeds start sprouting in the month of December but the sprouts become visible above the soil surface only by February. 75 m in hard and laterite soils; 0. 50 m in sandy and alluvial soils, at a spacing of 4 m x 4 m for grafts and 7 m x 7 m for seedlings. Fill the pits with topsoil and 5 kg of compost or well- decomposed cattle manure and 10 g of carbaryl 10 per cent dust, to avoid white ant attack, before planting. 1mm ) TAMARIND (Tamarindus indica) The tree is particularly well adapted to semi- arid tropical regions, but can be grown in heavy rainfall areas too, provided the soil is well drained. It is adaptable to poor soil also. 151 CAMBOGE AND TAMARIND BEVERAGES AND STIMULANTS ARECANUT (Areca catechu) The arecanut palms grow under a variety of climatic and soil conditions. It is grown in a variety of soils such as laterites, red loams and alluvial. Varieties Mangala, Sumangala, Sreemangala and Mohitnagar, VTLAH1, VTLAH2 Selection of site Select sites with deep well drained soil without high water table. Dig pits of size 60 cm x 60 cm x 60 cm and fill up with rich topsoil to a level of 15 cm from the bottom. Plant seedlings at the centre of pit, cover with soil up to collar level and press around. The planting is to be done during May-June in well-drained soils and during August-September in clayey soils. Apply the second dose of fertilizers around the base of palm after weeding and mix into soil by light forking. In acidic soils, broadcast lime   0. 5 kg per palm once in two or three years and incorporate into soil by forking during March-April. Irrigation and drainage Irrigate the palms during hot and dry periods at regular intervals depending upon the soil type. The palms should be irrigated once in four to seven days depending on the soil type and climatic factors. Application of organic mulch to the garden helps conservation of soil moisture. In slopes, prevent soil erosion by terracing. Root grub (Leucopholis burmeisteri) Loosen soil around the base of palms to a depth of 10-15 cm and drench with chlorpyrifos 0. Drench the soil with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture before planting healthy seedlings. Garden land   150 g lime and a minimum of 10 kg organic manure, 60 g magnesium sulphate per palm per year may be applied as in case of converted paddy field. Terraced upland   150 g lime and a minimum of 15 kg organic manure palm-1 year-1 may be applied as in case of garden land. Band disease Improve soil conditions by loosening hard soil strata, if present, by providing good drainage. Hyper nutrition or sudden flush of water after a period of drought or insufficient moisture in the soil is the probable cause (s) of the disease. It can be cultivated in the uplands as well as in wetlands. The crop grows best on well-drained fertile soils. Waterlogged, saline and alkali soils are unsuitable for its cultivation. The crop also comes up very well in lateritic soils. Preparation of land Areas with good shade and irrigation facilities are preferred for this crop. The land is dug well and laid out into furrows of 10-15 m length, 75 cm width and 75 cm depth. Well rotten farmyard manure and leaves are thoroughly incorporated with the topsoil of the furrows, along with wood ash. High dose of organic manure (20-50 t ha-1) is applied to maintain good soil structure, which is essential for the proper development of the root system. While planting, one node shall be buried in the soil and the second node should be at the ground level. The soil around the planted cutting must be pressed firmly to encourage quick germination. To prevent excess moisture in the soil, splashing water on the vines by hand is preferable in the early stages. Irrigation and drainage Betel vine needs constantly moist soil, but there should not be excessive moisture. Soil is put over the portion kept in the soil to about 5 cm thickness. The best soil for cocoa is forest soil rich in humus. The soil should allow easy penetration of roots and capable of retaining moisture during summer. Shallow soils should be avoided. Preparation of land The seedlings   budded clones are usually planted in the interspaces of coconut arecanut. Sowing is to be as shallow as to just cover the seeds with soil. Regular watering is necessary to keep the soil moist. Time and method of planting Raising cocoa as a pure crop is not recommended especially in Kerala due to high pressure on land. Pits of 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm are dug, allowed to weather for one month and refilled with topsoil and 15-20 kg of compost or FYM to ground level. The planting hole should be sufficient to hold the soil ball of the polybag. Tear off the polybags carefully, place the soil ball with the seedlings in the planting hole with minimum disturbance and press the soil around firmly. If sufficient moisture is not present in the soil due to prolonged drought or failure of rains, irrigation is to be given once in five days. ) The soil and climatic requirements for Arabica and Robusta varieties are as follows: Arabica Elevation : 1000-1500 m above MSL Annual rainfall : 1600-2500 mm Blossom rain : March-April (2. 5 cm) Shade : Uniform thin Temperature : 20-30ºC RH : 80-90 per cent In both cases, soil should be deep, friable, and rich in organic matter with a pH of 6. Sowing Germination bed (primary): Seeds are sown in raised seed beds (15 cm above the ground level) provided with proper drainage prepared out of soil, compost and sand at 6:2:1 proportion. 5 kg Preparation of land If it is a jungle, only selective felling of trees is done maintaining the trees, which are desirable at appropriate spacing. In June, the pits are covered with top soil and staked. In poor soils, 250 g of FYM or compost per pit may be added before filling. 5 cm apart in rows, with the flat side of the seed towards the soil. A thin layer of soil is spread after sowing and covered with dry straw to a thickness of about 5 cm to ensure uniform temperature and to regulate moisture retention. The bags are filled with prepared mixture of 6 parts of sieved jungle soil, 2 parts of well rotten sieved cattle manure and 1 part of fine sand. The soil is filled into the nursery baskets and pressed firm. Prior to transplanting, the nursery basket is watered and a vertical hole of 5 cm deep is made in the soil at the centre of the basket. The shoot portion of the transplanted seedling should be at the same height above soil level as it was in the germination bed. Secondary nursery beds In some areas, seedlings from the germination beds are transplanted to secondary nursery beds of the same soil composition as that of germination beds. A hole is made at the centre of the pit after levelling the soil. The soil around the seedling is packed 3 cm high above the ground to prevent stagnation of water around the collar. The seedling is gently removed from the bag with its soil and root system intact and planted in the hole. The hole is covered with soil and the plant is firmly fixed similar to ball plants. Single node green wood (semi-hardwood) cutting of 10 cm length and three to six months old are planted in polythene bags with the medium of jungle soil, sand and cattle manure in the proportion of 6:3:1. The soil around the seedlings should be mulched properly and shade has to be provided to individual seedlings to protect against direct sun. Irrigation Wherever water is available, overhead irrigation by sprinkler system is adopted to a greater advantage during November- January to keep the soil moisture level and in February-April for ensuring blossom as well as backing, if necessary. The occurrence of dieback is mainly due to adverse climatic and edaphic factors such as higher temperature, higher light intensity and low moisture status of soil. Conservation of soil moisture with thick mulch 4. Correcting the soil acidity by application of lime Shade and shade management Dadap (Erythrina lithosperma) is generally used as a lower canopy in India. When stakes are planted in June they grow quickly since sufficient moisture will be there in the soil. The soil should be acidic (around pH 5. Level the land into an even slope to facilitate easy cultural operations and proper drainage. Early high yield, better soil conservation, less weed growth, efficient cultural practices and better supervision are other advantages of double hedge planting. Keep the top and bottom soil separately. In clayey soil and drought-prone areas, deeper pits (60 cm) or trench planting will be advanta- geous. Planting seasons Southwest monsoon areas: June-July Northeast monsoon areas: September- October Planting If the soil pH is more than 5. 5, apply 100 g of powdered aluminium sulphate per pit and thoroughly mix with soil. After planting the seedling, compact the soil surrounding the plant and apply mulch   25 t ha-1. Rates of application for soils with pH between 4.

In the semi-circular furrow taken above the plant on the slope, using a Kokra-eyebrow method, apply the fertilizers when there is adequate soil moisture and when the fields are free from weeds. Punch holes of 15-22 cm depth in the soil on either side of the plants and place the rock phosphate. Centering should be done 4-6 months after planting during humid weather when there is adequate moisture in the soil. Rates of application for soils with pH above 5. Seed should be sown in raised beds of 1 m width and of convenient length using sandy loam soil with a pH around 6. Apply a mixture of 100 g rock phosphate and 400 g dolomite per pit and thoroughly mix with soil prior to planting. Management Nursery Heat treatment: Spread soil sand mixture (5 cm thick) on a G. Mix the soil thoroughly by turning. Soil should not be too hot to hold in the hand. Over heating of soil will lead to man- ganese toxicity. Management Nursery : Heat treatment of soil is effective.

Soils with good fertility and assured supply of moisture are best suited. Preparation of land Prepare the field by ploughing or digging and dig pits for planting. Size of pits depends upon soil type, water table and variety. Spacing Spacing may be provided as indicated below: Planting Plant suckers upright in the centre of pits with 5 cm pseudostem remaining above soil level. Press soil around the sucker to avoid hollow air spaces. Incorporate the cowpea crop into soil 40 days after sowing. Nendran (irrigated): 190:115:300 Other varieties depending upon soil fertility level: 160-200 : 160-200 : 320-400 Palayankodan (rainfed): 100:200:400 Palayankodan (reclaimed alluvial soils of Kuttanad) Plant crop : 100:200:400 First ratoon : 150:200:800 Second ratoon : 150:200:800 Apply the fertilizer 60-75 cm around the plant in two equal split doses; the first, two months after planting and the second, four months after planting. Incorporate the crop into the soil 40 days after sowing. Repeat sowing of green manure crop and incorporate into soil 40 days after sowing. About 6-10 irrigations per crop may be given depending upon soil conditions. Do not disturb soil after plants start producing bunches. Fill the pits with topsoil and FYM 15- 20 kg per plant per pit. Manures and Fertilizers Apply FYM   15-20 kg per plant and lime 1 kg per plant at the time of land preparation. Remove affected plants along with the rhizome in full and destroy them by burning the life stages of the insect using kerosene or by burying the material in deep pits in soil. Drenching all the leaf axils, rhizome and surrounding soil and all round the entire pseudostem inserting the nozzle through the bore holes made by the larvae if any and also within the outer sheathes by slightly raising the same at different spots is also effective. Deep ploughing of the land so as to expose the inner soil layer to sun. Drench the soil around affected clumps with 2 g l -1 carbendazim solution to prevent spread of disease. It grows well on any type of soil. Red sandy loam soil with good drainage is the most ideal for commercial cultivation of guava. Fill the pits with topsoil, sand and cowdung. These may be applied in two or three split doses when there is sufficient moisture in the soil. 215 GUAVA INDIAN GOOSEBERRY (Phyllanthus emblica) Indian Gooseberry Emblica Nelli is quite hardy and can be grown with little care in all types of soil except very sandy type. Soil should be deep and well drained. Any rise in water table or poor aeration of the soil is detrimental to the crop. Fill pits with mixture of topsoil and 10 kg compost or FYM per pit to a level higher than the adjoining ground. Ensure that the graft joint is above the soil level. It requires deep soil rich in humus. Preparation of land Dig pits of size 70 cm x 60 cm x 70 cm at a spacing of 7-8 m at least one month in advance of planting. While planting, remove the bandage around the bud joint and keep the bud joint at least 10-15 cm above soil surface. Intercropping Crops like coffee, cardamom, banana and pineapple can be planted as intercrops depending on soil fertility status. Against root and collar rot, removal of soil from the base of the trunk, scraping of the dead bark and application of lime sulphur are to be done. MANGO (Mangifera indica) Mango is adaptable to a wide range of climate and soil conditions and grows well from sea level up to about 1500 m above mean sea level.

Pineapple can be grown in a wide range of soils, but does not tolerate waterlogging. Preparation of the land Prepare the land for planting by ploughing or digging followed by levelling. Depending on the nature of land, prepare trenches of convenient length and about 90 cm width and 15-30 cm depth. Planting Rake the soil and plant the suckers in double rows at spacing of 45 cm x 30 cm. After application of fertilizers, cover with soil by scraping the sides of trenches. Spraying should be done when there is adequate moisture in the soil. Cropping system Mauritius can be grown as a pure crop in garden land, reclaimed lowlands and wetlands and as an intercrop in coconut and newly planted rubber plantations. Land preparation Pure crop : Prepare the land by digging the area to be planted at 90 cm width in rows  strips, leaving the interspaces undisturbed. However, ploughing can be adopted in level land. Intercropping in coconut garden: Land preparation, spacing and planting are the same as described above. Cowpea, sunhemp or daincha can be sown in the interspaces and covered with soil soon PINEAPPLE 224 after planting the suckers. Wetlands   lowlands: Pineapple is highly sensitive to water stagnation and high moisture regimes. Hence it is important to provide good drainage, if grown in wetlands. In paddy lands, pineapple is planted in paired rows at 45 cm x 30 cm spacing on ridges taken at 60-90 cm height, depending on the water table and drainage requirement. Planting After preliminary land preparations, planting is done in small pits of 10-15 cm depth at a spacing of 45 cm between rows and 30 cm between plants in the rows. Spraying should be done in moist soil, but avoid rainy periods. The water table should be at least 60 cm below the soil surface. Badly affected plants should be destroyed and the remaining plants should be drenched with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture in the soil. It can be grown in all types of soil, but well drained soil is necessary for good growth. It is best suited as a homestead fruit crop and prefers a rich well drained soil. The ideal soil types are loam, sandy loam and silt loam with open porous and well-drained subsoil. Fill the pit with topsoil and 10 kg cowdung. These may be applied in two splits, in June-July and again in January, when there is sufficient moisture in the soil. Preparation of land The planting distance in India varies from 7-10 m, depending upon the vigour of plant. Fertilizers should be mixed with the soil at a radius of 1 m from the plant. Monopodial orchids can be grown on ground above soil level. The flowers are used for preparing garlands. Soil and climate Jasmine can be planted on a wide range of soils.

Climate and soil The plant is found through out India from near sea level to 2300 m altitude, particularly in rock crevices and laterite soil. It grows well in moist humus   rich soils especially in shady forest areas and rubber plantations. New propagules also emerge from leaf tips in contact with soil during monsoon. Land preparation Plough the field to good tilth. Soil should be sufficiently moist to get maximum rhizome development. Climate and soil The plant is present in select pockets of India, mainly in the forests. Land preparation Select an area receiving 50-75 percent shade (natural or artificial shade provided by shade net). Bulbils are placed horizontally over the beds, they are just pressed gently into the soil. Cover the soil with mulch for the first 4-5 months, keep the soil moist always. It grows on a wide range of climate and soil. Fertile red loams to forest soils are suitable. Land preparation Plough the field to good tilth. Planting Pits of 30 cm3 size are taken at a spacing of 60 cm x30 cm distance and filled with 10 kg dried cowdung and top soil and formed into a mound. Climate and soil Asoka grows well in areas with well-distributed rainfall and in slightly shady areas. It grows on a wide range of soils. Planting Square shaped pits of 60 cm depth are taken at 3 m spacing and filled with topsoil, sand and dried cow dung. Climate and soil The plant is distributed throughout India in deciduous forests up to 1200 m. It is grown in different soil types such as laterite, sandy and alluvial. The saplings are later transplanted to the main field on to pits of about 1m x 1m taken at a spacing of 6m x 6m, filled with top soil and organic manure. After cultivation The basins of the trees are cleared of weeds and after application of manures and fertilizers covered with soil. It is cut at a height of 15 cm from soil level. Preparation of land Thippali is highly adapted for warm humid tropical climate. Fertile, loamy soil having good drainage is ideal for this crop. Sandy soil with high organic content is also well suited. Season, method of planting and manuring In a well ploughed land, beds of 1m width and of convenient length may be taken and pits are taken at a spacing of 60 cm x 30 cm. Climate and soil The tree is well distributed throughout the tropics and subtropics. Well drained loamy soils are suitable for its cultivation. The pit is covered with FYM  1 kg pit and top soil. Cultivation It can be grown in any type of soil but cannot tolerate waterlogging. Land preparation and planting Plough the field, and pits of size 60 cm x 60 cm x 45 cm are taken at a distance of 4 m. The pit is covered with FYM  1 kg pit and top soil. Well- drained loamy soils are best suited for cultivation. Cultivation It is grown in well-drained soil and cannot tolerate waterlogging. Apply FYM  com- post   2 kg bed and mix well with soil. The seeds are sown at a depth of 1-2 cm and cover with soil or FYM. Apply FYM or compost   5t ha-1 at the time of land prepara- tion. Climate and Soil The tree is well distributed in Western Ghats, Deccan, parts of Gujarat and Konkan areas. Well drained forest soil and laterite loamy soils are suitable. The seedlings are transplanted at a spacing of 5m x 5m in pits of size of 60 cm x 60 cm x 45cm covered with farm yard manure   2kg pit and top soil. Weeding is done two times along with slight raking of soil during the first weeding. takes place from nodes above soil. The grass is adapted to a wide range of soils. It usually grows on well-drained light textured soil, preferably sandy loams or loams, but is better suited to medium to highly fertile loams. Mix with soil and cover the trenches and form ridges of 15 cm height for planting slips. In acid soils, application of lime   500 kg ha-1 in alternate years is desirable. The crop should be subsequently irrigated depending upon the rainfall and soil type. The grass avoids heavy soil, is resistant to grass fires and develops new leaves and shoots a few days after burning. It can come up in a variety of soil types. This perennial grass requires thorough land preparation; two or three ploughings diggings followed by one levelling. The land should be free from weeds. The row-to-row distance may be increased to 60-70 cm when the soil is poor and irrigation facility is absent. Organic manure, either FYM or compost   10 t ha-1 may be applied at the time of land preparation. The fertilizer requirement depends on the initial nutrient status of the soil. The grass flourishes in moist, but not wet soils. The plants tiller freely and a single clump may produce 50 tillers under favourable climatic and soil conditions. Hybrid Pennisetum can grow on a variety of soils. Light loams and sandy soils are preferred to heavy soils. The grass does not thrive well on waterlogged and flood prone lands. Phenomenal yields are obtained from very deep fertile soil rich in organic matter. The cuttings with three nodes are stuck into the soil with the basal end down, either vertically or at an angle to such a depth that two nodes remain within the soil and one above the soil surface. Farm yard manure   25 t ha-1 and P2O5 and K2O   50 kg ha-1 each may be applied at the time of land preparation. It can withstand short term flooding and waterlogging but cannot be grown in dryland in arid and semi-arid regions. The grass grows in moist, but not in highly wet soils. It thrives best on highly fertile clay loam to clayey textured soils with high moisture retention capacity. It can be grown even on sandy soils with good irrigation facility. It tolerates slightly acid to alkaline soils. It is highly tolerant to saline or sodic soil conditions. It grows well on field bunds, banks of streams and canals, lowlands and soils too wet for normal farm crops. Prepare the land thoroughly by three or four ploughings and remove weeds. The land should be kept weed free for the first two months. It is a creeping perennial with dense foliage and therefore can be used for soil conservation purpose as strip crop. It can be grown in almost all types of soils but cannot tolerate waterlogging. Prepare the land by ploughing one or two times, removing weeds and levelling. It requires a deep well drained neutral soil and can tolerate saline and acid soil. The land should, however, be cleared of bushes, ploughed and levelled before sowing. In gravelly soil and in low rainfall areas, a yield of 25-30 tonnes per ha per year may be obtained. It is an ideal plant for wasteland development. Fodder cowpea can be profitably grown as a summer crop in rice fallow of sandy loam soils where water is not available to raise a subsequent crop. Cowpea can be grown on a wide range of soils from heavy to sandy loam with a pH range of 5. Saline, alkaline or waterlogged soils should be avoided. The sub-marginal lands that are not suited for agricultural purposes can be used for growing this fodder plant. Most of its species are native of south and central America and the Caribbean Islands. The crop controls soil erosion by giving a protective soil cover. Usually they have a crown of growing points near the soil surface. For rainfed crop, at the time of land preparation, FYM   10 t ha-1 is applied and basal application of N, P2O5 and K2O   25, 60 and 30 kg ha-1 is recommended. If there is lack of soil moisture, shallow irrigation at 3-4 cm depth once in 15 days during summer and once in a month during post-monsoon period is good. The plant thrives well in light soils due to its deep rooting system. It can be cultivated in areas receiving less than 1000 mm of rainfall and in less fertile soil, acid soils, gravelly sandy soils and also in ill-drained soils. In less fertile soils like sandy coastal soils, phosphorus fertilizer should also be added along with sowing of seeds so as to help the development of root nodules. Irrigation is required if there is no proper soil moisture at the time of sowing. Seeds are sown broadcast and covered with thin layer of soil or dibbled at a spacing of 30 cm STYLO 270 FODDER CEREALS FODDER MAIZE (Zea mays) Maize grows best in warm climate where the day temperature is fairly light. The crop comes up well in soils with good drainage and fair moisture status. The land is ploughed two or three times and beds and channels are formed. FYM   10 t ha-1 may be applied at the time of preparation of land as basal dressing. A second cut can also be taken if there is sufficient moisture in the soil. Application of lime   375 kg ha-1 is also recommended in acid soils. This crop adapts to varying conditions of soil and climate. Wild indigo or kolingi (Tephrosia purpurea) It is a slow growing green manure crop suitable for light soils. Better yield is obtained when two irrigations are given and when grown in clayey soil. All soils except sandy soils are suited for the crop. FODDERV SORGHUM AND GREEN MANURE CROPS 272 GREEN LEAF MANURE CROPS Gliricidia (Gliricidia maculata) It is a shrub, which takes up a tree habit under favourable conditions of soil and climate. AGROFORESTRY Agroforestry refers to land management systems that integrate agricultural crops with forest crops. It is a collective term for all land use systems and practices in which woody perennials are deliberately grown on the same land management unit as crops or animals, either in some form of a spatial arrangement or in a time sequence and in which there is a significant interaction between the woody perennials and the crops or animals. Agrisilviculture refers to systems in which agricultural crops are integrated with trees on the same land management unit either in time or space. Examples include taungya, alley cropping, multipurpose trees either as woodlots or as scattered trees on farmlands or on farm boundaries, crop combinations involving woody perennial plantation crops, growing commercial crops in association with planted shade trees or trees in natural forests, shelterbelts, energy planta- tions, enriched fallow and so on. Silvopastoralism represents land manage- ment systems in which forests including forest plantations are managed for the concurrent production of wood and livestock. They also refer to situations in which trees are scattered in pasture grasslands, protein banks  cut and carry fodder production system involving woody perennials and the like. Agrosilvopastoral systems, the most intensive form of land management, are systems in which the land is managed concurrently for the production of agricultural and forest crops and for rearing of domesti- cated animals. These include, collection of non-timber forest products from forests, growing trees around wetlands and other water bodies in which fish culture is practised, apiculture with trees and multipurpose woodlots etc. Preferably sand, soil and FYM (1:1:1 ratio) must form the top layer of the beds. After sowing, a thin layer of soil is sprinkled on the beds to cover the seeds. They are then pricked out into polythene bags containing 1:1:1 mixture of sand, soil and FYM. If the soil is sandy, mix farmyard manure with the topsoil. The rooted cuttings are then transferred to a mixture of sand, soil and farm yard manure (2:1:1) for hardening. Therefore, it thrives best on sandy soils low in nitrogen and has the potential to improve the nitrogen capital of impoverished sites. Site preparation includes ploughing the land 2-3 times and making 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm pits before the onset of monsoon. The pits are filled with FYM and topsoil. They are evergreen species, all more or less aromatic and containing oil glands in their leaves. grandis grows best in deep, permanently moist, well-drained soils. tereticornis also prefers moist and well-drained soils such as loamy sands or alluvial loams, with high nutrient availability. A certain degree of salinity is tolerated, but strongly acid soils are ill suited. Fertilizers may be Maintaining a soil pH of 6. Mangium shows most vigorous growth on well-drained, fertile soils in high rainfall areas ( 2000 mm annually) in the humid tropics. It prefers a warm moist tropical climate with mean annual precipitation of 1100-2000 mm and a well-drained fertile soil. Root feeders (Sternocera aequisignata) can be controlled by chlorpyrifos application to the soil or seedbeds. Sand and soil mixed with FYM form the top layer. A thin layer of soil also can be sprinkled to cover the seeds. Important uses of bamboo include paper and pulp industry, fuel, food, feed, house construction and scaffolding, making several articles of everyday use, besides controlling soil erosion. These offsets are planted out sufficiently deep in the soil to cover the first two or three nodes. Prepare raised nursery beds of 10 m x 1 m and fill with a mixture of soil and sand (3:1). Cover the cuttings with a thin layer of soil. The conditions favourable for seed germination and seedling growth are moderate shade, loose and fairly moist soil. Pits are taken before the onset of monsoon and filled with 5 Kg of FYM and top soil. It thrives best on well drained, deep, moist soil, particularly in the neighbourhood of perennial streams. Sandal, which is distributed from sea level up to about 1800 m height, is found to grow in a variety of soils. Sandal which grow on sandy soil are more fragrant. Soil beds of size 10 x 1m are used for sowing. Before this, soil has to be thoroughly mixed with Ekalux. It increases the soil nitrogen content. Natural propagation becomes easier if soil is wet and a host plant like Lantana is available near. In the second method, seeds are placed in large pits   soil mound along with host plants. Heavy rainfall and properly drained and aerated soil are necessary for its growth. Seen abundantly along river banks and hill slopes with fertile soil. After sowing, soil covering of thickness not more than 4 mm is given. River banks and places with red soil are best suited for its growth. Lateritic soil is also found to be good for this species. Poor growth in clay soil. Seeds are sown on loose soil. Avoid clay soil. Standard pits are filled with rich top soil and FYM 5 kg. Abundant growth occurs in places with average annual rainfall of 1500-5000 mm and in fertile laterite soil. Planting is done in pits of 35 cm cube filled with top soil and 10 kg of FYM. Very suitable for afforestation purposes in open places with clayey soil. Root system grows deeply in the soil. Though the tree can grow in almost all types of soils, laterite soil with proper drainage is best suited. Even though they grow in almost all types of soil, good drainage is essential. Protecting trees from animals and fire and also ploughing the soil enhances natural propagation. Planting and management Site preparation includes ploughing the land and making 30 cm cube pits before the onset of monsoon. Pits are filled with red soil and 5 kg FYM. This grows well on soil which is best suited for teak plantations. Grown well in sandy and alluvial soils. It prefers a sandy loam soil. PUNNA AND AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM 294 AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONES OF KERALA Agricultural productivity and agro- biodiversity of an area are largely governed by the overhead climate and qualities of land and soil. In the tropics and subtropics, where sunlight and temperatures are not limiting, it is often the precipitation and the capacity of the land and soil to retain water that control biological productivity. An agro-ecological delineation is characterised by distinct ecological responses to the macro-elements, which are reflected in the vegetation, soils and agricultural land use. The significance of homogeneous agricultural environment, as realised in the agro-ecological unit is of particular importance in effective and sustainable land use to enhance agricultural output for meeting the increasing demand for food, fodder, fibre and other products. With the growing demand for food, fodder and fibre, there is overuse of land or faulty planning of land use that has resulted in soil health hazards such as soil degradation and deterioration of land quality. The basis of spatial delineations was variability in altitude, rainfall pattern, soil type and topography. The National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS   LUP) generated a map of Agro-ecological Regions of the country (Sehgal et al. , 1992) by integrating climate, physiography, length of growing period and soils, an improvement on the agro-climatic zone map of the Planning Commission which considered only physiography and climate for delineation of zones. The agro-ecological regions (AER) map of NBSS   LUP had 20 regions and the entire state of Kerala formed part of region 19: Western Ghats and Coastal Plains, hot humid-perhumid eco-region, with 295 AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONES OF KERALA red, laterite and alluvium-derived soils and growing period of 210  days. In order to address the problem and to generate an agro-ecological units map of the state, the Kerala State Planning Board commissioned a project to National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning in 2008. The analysis of agro-ecology of Kerala State based primarily on climate, geomorphology, land use and soil variability resulted in delineation of five agro-ecological zones and twenty three agro-ecological units. Coastal Plain The Coastal Plain agro-ecological zone comprises the nearly level to gently sloping lands along the coast at elevation below 30 metres and lying between the sea and the midlands. It includes sandy beaches, sandy plains, coastal laterites and low lying areas such as estuaries, backwaters, submerged lands, swamps, marshes, kayal lands and broad valleys. Midland Laterites Midland Laterites agro-ecological zone comprises undulating to rolling lands interspersed with narrow valleys between the coastal plain on the west and foothills and hills on the east, extending from the southern end to the northern end of the state. Foothills The undulating to rolling lands and low hills between the midland laterite on the west and high hills on the eastern side constitute the Foothills agro-ecological zone. The Western Ghats and highland plateaus rise 600 metres above mean sea level, with a number of peaks well over 1800 metres. Palakkad Plain The Palakkad Gap, resembling an inland plain with low elevation, is a prominent physical feature along the valley of the Bharathapuzha river. The gently sloping lands of Palakkad, east of Kuthiran hills, flanked on the south and north by Nelliyampathy hills and Attappady hills, respectively and merging to Tamil Nadu uplands through the gap in Western Ghats constitute the agro-ecological zone, covering 1,60,006 ha (4. 1 Agro-ecological Zones of Kerala 297 AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONES OF KERALA AGRO-ECOLOGICAL UNITS Twenty three agro-ecological units (AEU s) have been delineated for the state based on climatic variability, landform and soils.

The uplands of the unit have slightly acid or neutral red clay soils well supplied with bases and plant nutrients. Lower parts of the uplands and lowlands have alkaline, swell- shrink clay soils. The fertile soils are rich in bases and plant nutrients. Lowlands have impeded drainage. REFERENCES FAO (1976) A Framework for Land Evaluation. Soils Bulletin 32. The top is then covered with a thin layer of soil. After three months of decomposition, the mass is taken out of the trench and formed into a conical heap above the ground, moistened with water if necessary and covered with soil. A layer of soil of 3 cm depth and a layer of coconut fibre of 5 cm depth may be added above it for draining of excess moisture. This is used for soil application and foliar spray in different crops. Azotobacter Suitable for upland crops like vegetables, tapioca, plantation and orchard crops. It fixes about 15 20 kg of N per ha under ideal upland conditions and thereby reduces the requirement of nitrogen fertilizers by 10-20 per cent. Methods of application are seed treatment, seedling dip and direct soil application. Azospirillum It is suitable for both upland and wetland conditions and is available as carrier-based inoculum. The isolates of Azospirillum brasilense strains AZR 15 and AZR 37 from Kuttanad soils are highly effective for rice, vegetables and nursery plants. Soil application: Mix the culture with FYM or compost in the ratio 1:25 and apply directly in the soil. It improves the water infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity of soil. Blue green algae (BGA) Mainly recommended for wetland rice cultivation. However, the use of this biofertilizer is not feasible in acidic soils with pH below 6. Azolla It is suitable for wetland rice cultivation. Phosphate solubilising bacteria and fungi Recommended mainly for upland crops raised in neutral and slightly alkaline soils. ) is mostly recommended for upland crops, especially for raising container and tissue culture plantlets and transplanted crops. Mycorrhiza inoculation can improve the survival and establishment of tissue culture plantlets under field conditions as well as induce better resistance against certain soil borne plant pathogens. It is commercially available as granular inoculum consisting of infected roots and soil with mycorrhizal spores. It is given as soil application. The rate of spore load in the inoculum should be to the tune of 50 to 400 spores per 100 g soil medium. The treated seeds are spread evenly over a gunny bag and dried in shade and sown BIOFERTILIZERS 312 immediately in moist soil. Soil application Soil application is generally recommended for all types of biofertilizers except Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium and Azorhizobium. This is essential to ensure better survival, growth and activity of the introduced microbial inoculum in acidic soils. Liming is essential if the soil pH is below 6. In moderately acidic soils, the application of lime at the rate of 250 kg ha -1 is recommended along with biofertilizer treatment. Irrigation is essential during summer months after biofertilizer application to ensure the survival of the introduced microbial inoculum in the soil. In moderately acidic soils of pH around 6. Application of P2O5 at the rate of 1 kg ha -1 is recommended once in 4 days in P2O5 deficient soils to ensure good growth of azolla. Since a floating population of azolla can release its bound nutrients only during decay in the soil, it is essential to incorporate azolla in the soil prior to the transplanting of rice seedlings. In submerged rice soil, ammoniacal and ammonia producing fertilizers like urea are most suitable since ammonia is the most stable form of nitrogen under such conditions. For acidic upland soils, ammoniacal fertilizers are most suitable during rainy season since ammonium is adsorbed on soil particles and hence leaching losses are reduced. In highly acidic upland soils, urea is preferred to ammonium sulphate as the former is less acid forming. In alkaline upland soils of low rainfall regions, nitrate fertilizers are preferred to ammoniacal fertilizers or urea since ammonia may be lost by volatilization under alkaline conditions. Nitrogen losses from fertilizers are more in coarse textured soils with low cation exchange capacity (CEC) than in fine textured soils. Hence more number of splits is necessary to reduce loss of fertilizer nitrogen from sandy and other light soils. In coarse textured sandy or loamy soils, the entire dose of nitrogenous fertilizers may be applied in 3-4 splits at different stages of growth of rice crop. In double cropped wetlands, 50 per cent of N requirement of the first crop may be applied in the organic form. Almost 70 per cent of N in urea applied by broadcast to flooded soil is lost by volatilization, immobilization and by denitrification Measures to reduce the loss of N from applied urea 1. Urea super granules or urea briquettes may be used in places where soil is clayey and has cation exchange capacity more than 10 cmol ( ) per kg of soil. Sulphur or lac coated urea is suitable where soil is liable to intermittent flooding and in situations where water management is difficult. Urea may be mixed with moist soil and kept for 24-48 hours before application to the field. Alternatively, urea may be mixed with moist soil, made into balls of about three inch diameter and dried under shade. The balls may be placed deep into subsoil. For submerged soils, coating urea with coal tar and kerosene (100 kg urea is mixed with 2 kg coal tar dissolved in one litre kerosene) before mixing with neem cake is preferred to simple mixing with neem cake. 5 hours before applying in direct seeded puddled lowland rice increases nitrogen use efficiency. Deep placement of prilled urea or super granules during the last ploughing followed by flooding and planting is beneficial in light soils. Phosphatic fertilizers Fertilizer phosphorus is an expensive input and its management poses serious problems due to several complexities in its behaviour in different types of soil. In slightly acid, neutral or mildly alkaline soils, water soluble phosphatic fertilizers are more suitable. In wetland rice soils, water soluble phos- phatic fertilizers are preferable as pH of most of the submerged soils is near neutral. In strongly acidic soils whose pH does not rise above 5. For highly acidic upland soils or submerged soils whose pH will not rise GUIDELINES FOR MAXIMIZING FERTILIZER USE EFFICIENCY 316 above 5. Soil acidity converts tricalcium phosphate in rock phosphate to plant available monocalcium form. In black soil (Chittur taluk of Palakkad District) phosphatic fertilizers containing water soluble phosphate like single superphosphate are most suitable. Acid soils have to be amended with lime, dolomite or magnesium silicate and alkali soils with iron pyrite or sulphur before application of phosphatic fertilizers. Rock phosphates can be used advanta- geously in rice, grown in acid soils during the virippu season. Powdered rock phosphate may be applied and mixed thoroughly with soil by ploughing. When soil available P status is medium to high P application can be skipped. For low P status soil , P should be applied   45 kg P2O5 ha-1. K status of soil is maintained by straw incorporation. After straw incorporation, if soil analysis prior to cropping season indicates low K status, K should be applied   15 kg K2O ha -1. In single crop wetlands where rice is grown in the virippu season, application of phosphatic fertilizers can be dispensed with for the rice crop, if the second crop (usually legume or green manure) is given phosphatic fertilizers. In case of rice-legume cropping sequence in acid soils, application of rock phosphate to the pulse crop helps to skip phosphatic fertilizers in the succeeding rice crop. Under adverse soil conditions and where quick result is required, spraying water-soluble phosphatic fertilizers like triple superphosphate or hot water extract of superphosphate can be resorted to. They build nests (combs) with wax secreted from the wax glands of worker bees. In coarse textured soils and in heavy rainfall regions, potassium fertilizers should be applied in as many splits as possible, to reduce loss of potassium. In fine textured soils, the entire dose of potassium fertilizers may be applied as basal. In acid soils, potassium fertilizers should be applied only after lime application to prevent loss of potassium by leaching. Lime Acid soils are characterised by high saturation of the exchange complex with hydrogen and aluminium. Crops grown in such soils suffer due to unavailability of most plant nutrients, especially calcium. In acidic submerged soils, flooding brings about rise in soil pH and hence response to lime is less marked. For better results, liming materials should be incorporated into the soil. In case of wetland rice, drain the field prior to lime application and reflood after 24 hours. Flushing the soil by sequential flooding and draining will help to wash out the displaced acid from the soil. The soil should be deep, fertile, well drained, clay loam to loam and with good moisture holding capacity. 8 pH) soil free from injurious salts is ideal for the growth of mulberry. Land preparation The field is levelled and ploughed deeply before the onset of monsoon. FYM may be applied   10 t ha-1 for the rainfed crop and 20 t ha-1 for the irrigated crop during land preparation. Root knot disease (Meloidogyne incognita) Common in sandy loam type of soil under irrigated conditions. Collect undersized larvae and destroy regularly by burning or burrowing in soil. They damage paddy by cutting the plants in dryland paddy areas. The rats will come and close the burrows with soil within 30 minutes. No pre-baiting is necessary for these rats in the garden lands since it has no bait shyness. 333 BIOCONTROL AGENTS AGAINST PLANT PATHOGENS BIOCONTROL AGENTS AGAINST PLANT PATHOGENS Arbuscular mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) Inoculation with AMF at the time of plant- ing in the nursery or main field improves the growth and tolerance of crop against root pathogens, particularly Phytophthora, Pythium, Rhizoctonia and root nematodes of black pepper, cardamom, ginger, turmeric, cowpea, upland rice and transplanted veg- etables.

The talc-based formulation at 1-2 per cent level may be used for soil drenching and spraying. SOIL SOLARIZATION Solarization is a method of hydrothermal disinfection. This is done by covering moist soil with transparent polythene sheet and exposing it to direct sunlight during the hottest period of the year. Incorporate the required quantity of organic manure in the soil and irrigate at the rate of 5 litres per m2. Seal the edges of the sheet with soil to keep it in position in order to maintain the temperature and moisture inside the polythene mulch. Adequate care is also to be taken to see that the sheet is in close contact with the surface of soil to prevent the formation of air pockets between the soil and polythene sheet. Moisten with 335 SOIL SOLARIZATION water using a rose-can and cover the soil with polythene sheet and solarize for 20-30 days as described above. After solarization, the soil can be used for sowing planting. Main field Solarization can also be effectively used for the control of soil borne diseases in the main field. The land used for planting is initially prepared to a fine tilth and pebbles removed. Biopesticides and fertilizers can be incorporated in soil after removing the polythene sheet. Soil should be kept moist during solarization to increase the thermal sensitivity of resting structures of soil-borne plant pathogens and weeds and to improve heat conduction. Soil should be in good tilth allowing close contact between the plastic sheet and the soil to prevent the formation of air pockets, which will reduce heat conduction. Control of fungal pathogens: Several soil borne pathogens can be controlled by solarization. Plant growth response: Increased growth response is observed in plants cultivated in solarized soil.

SOIL BASED RECOMMENDATIONS: In cases where crop-specific recommendations are not available, the following guidelines can be used for recommending secondary and micro nutrients. Secondary Nutrients (Ca, Mg, S) Calcium deficiency can be anticipated in extremely acidic, highly leached tropical soils. If the exchangeable Ca level is less than 300 mg kg-1, soils are classified as deficient. Magnesium deficiency can also be observed under extremely acidic soil environment. If the exchangeable Mg level is less than 120 mg kg-1, soils are classified as deficient. Highly leached tropical soils may develop S deficiency. When available sulphur levels in soil are less than 5 mg kg-1, symptoms may appear. Micro nutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn and B) Kerala soils in general have high levels of iron and manganese. Deficiency situation may arise in sandy soils with neutral alkaline reaction. When the available Fe is less than 5 mg kg-1 the soil is considered as deficient. Available Mn level less than 1 mg kg-1 soil condition is rated as deficient. Copper deficiency is observed in 31  of soils in Kerala. 12 mg kg-1 in neutral alkaline soils and below 1 mg kg-1 in acid soils is rated as deficient. Deficiency of Zn is observed in about 34  soils in Kerala. 6 mg kg-1 in neutral alkaline soils and 1 mg kg-1 in acid soils is rated as deficient condition. 5 Slightly acid 100 APPENDIX 14 388 Deficiency of B is observed in highly leached soils. 5 mg kg-1 in soil can be rated as deficient.

The micronutrients should be applied, if found deficient, only on soil test basis. The laterite and associated soils which constitute more than 70  of cultivated area in Kerala have shown low or medium status in terms of available micronutrients. More than 90  of the soils of Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam districts have shown deficiency of sulphur. Thrissur and Palakkad soils have also indicated deficiency in 80  cases. All soils of Kerala except black soils of Palakkad districts showed varying degrees of deficiency of available Mg. Kuttanad soils have shown deficiency of zinc, copper, calcium and magnesium. ",

As far as possible, fertile lands with irrigation and drainage facilities should be selected for raising the nurseries. 5 m width and of convenient length with drainage channels between the beds. Drain and incubate in warm moist place for sprouting. Drain occasionally to encourage production of vigorous seedlings with short roots. During first crop season, wherever transplanting is done depending upon receipt of rainfall, it is safer to adopt this method since growth of the seedlings can be controlled. Water the nursery as and when required depending upon the receipt of rains. Under ill drained conditions, long duration varieties may be planted 30 days after sowing. Apply fertilizers on the drained soil at the time of final ploughing and levelling and thoroughly mix into the soil. Kuttanad Drain out standing water from the main field. Provide surface drains of 20 cm width and depth within the field at 10-20 m interval or running diagonally (kachals) and join them with surface drain of 30 cm width and depth taken along the perimeter of the field (vachals). Phosphorus can be skipped for six seasons without any significant reduction in grain yield in riverine alluvium soils medium to high in available P. Fields are then drained during low tide and the sluices are closed. When the soil and weather conditions become favourable for sowing, the baskets containing the seeds are re-soaked for 3 to 6 hours before sowing. It is suitable for areas where efficient water management is possible (especially during rabi) and during kharif in areas where torrential rains are absent. During the first crop season, when basal application of nitrogen is not possible due to incessant rains, basal dose can be shifted to 15 days after transplanting. Basal dose of nitrogen may be postponed to initial tillering phase of rice crop, especially during the rainy season. In sequential cropping of rice, application of 50 per cent of the nutrient requirement (on nitrogen equivalent basis) as organics (FYM, rice straw, green manure) and 50 per cent as fertilizers during kharif season and the entire dose of nutrients as fertilizers in rabi season enhances the grain and straw yield. In areas where availability of water is assured, temporarily draining the field one day prior to application and re-flooding after twelve hours is recommended for top dressing of fertilizer. Split application of water-soluble phosphatic fertilizers in two equal splits as basal and at maximum tillering stage is effective in giving higher grain and straw yield than the full dose as basal dressing under certain situations. Application of magnesium as basal dose in the form of magnesium sulphate (16 per cent MgO) or magnesite (40 per cent MgO) or dolomite (10 per cent MgO)   20 kg MgO ha is effective in giving a significant increase in grain and straw yield of rice in magnesium deficient soils. In non- deficient soils, a marginal increase in grain and straw yield is also obtained. Drain water 13 days before harvest. 21 RICE Note: In areas where water for irrigation is assured and where acidity is high, draining and reflooding every 15 days is recommended. Grain yield reduction in the above practice is only 0. Drain the field before herbicide application. Drain the field after 10 days of flooding and broadcast the germinated rice seeds, without further ploughing. Pre sowing herbicide application to prevent the establishment of weedy rice seedlings After land preparation, drain the field to retain only a thin film of water. (2) Drain the field before herbicide application. Due to desapping, grains show brownish discoloured patches on the husk. Drain away water from the field and keep it in that conditions until the pest population dwindle. It occurs in ill drained fields. Management Drain away the water from the fields. The grains will be partially filled or unfilled. If the panicle is infected before grain filling stage, the entre panicle will be chaffy. The symptoms also appear on glumes as black oval or oblong spots or whole surface of the grain turn black and velvety. On the affected grains pale brown to whitish spots with dark brown margin bearing black dosts in the center are formed. The grains become chaffy. False smut (Ustilaginoidea vireus) The symptoms visible only after flowering when infected grains get transformed to yellow to orange spore balls, which later turns to dark green or black. When the field preparation and planting are done on rainy seasons, postpone the application of the basal dose of nitrogen to the early tillering stage (10 days after planting). Drain the required mat area 6-12 hours before cutting for feeding into the transplanter trays. Main field should have irrigation and drainage facility. This farming system is capable to produce 6-8 tons of paddy grain, 1. Maize grows best in areas with rainfall of 600- 900 mm. It requires fertile, well-drained soil with a pH ranging from 5. Season As a rainfed crop, maize is grown in June-July or August-September. Dibble one seed per hole at a spacing of 60 cm x 23 cm for the rainy season crop. The optimum temperature for growth is 30oC and it needs about 250-400 mm rainfall. Seasons Rainfed crop : May-August Irrigated crop : January-April Varieties Co.

It does not tolerate heavy rainfall and requires a dry spell at the time of grain ripening. Relatively fertile and well drained soils are the most suitable. Fertilizers may be applied as follows: Nutrients   ha Irrigated crop Rainfed crop N 90 kg 45 kg P2O5 45 kg 25 kg K2O 45 kg 25 kg Apply FYM and entire quantity of phos- phorus and potash as basal dose. As a rainfed crop, sowing is done along with pre-monsoon showers. Grain type : C-152, S-488, Pusa Phalguni, P-118, Pusa Do Fasli, Krishnamony (PTB-2), V-240, Amba (V-16), GC-827, CO-3, Pournami (summer rice fallows) and Shubhra (suited for cultivation in rice fallows during summer season in southern districts of Kerala), Sreya and Hridya (Summer rice fallows of Onattukara). Floor crop : Gujarat V-118, CO-2 Seeds and Sowing Seed rate For grain and dual purpose type Broadcasting : 60-65 kg ha-1 (45 kg ha-1for Krishnamony) Dibbling : 50-60 kg ha-1 (40 kg ha-1 for Krishnamony) Spacing : 25 cm x 15 cm Dibbling two seeds per hole Bush : 30 cm X 15 cm Trailing : 2 m X 2 m (on pandal   three plants per pit) Sowing Soaking seeds in 500 ppm thiourea solution, followed by two sprays of thiourea (one at vegetative and another at flowering stage) increased the yield of cowpea by 26 per cent and net return by 50 per cent. The strains that are available at Pattambi are the two isolates (No. Spacing For grain type and dual-purpose type, if dibbling is adopted, spacing of 25 cm between rows and 15 cm between plants is recommended with two seeds per hole. Make channels of 30 cm breadth and 15 cm depth at 2 m apart to drain off excess rainwater. For grain and dual-purpose varieties, decapitation is found to be advantageous as the crop shows trailing tendency. Light sandy-loam to clayey-loam soils with good drainage are best suited for the crop. Channels, 30 cm broad and 15 cm deep, are drawn at 2 m apart to drain off excess rain water during kharif season and provide irrigation during summer season. Well-drained loamy and laterite soils are suitable. Line sowing is helpful for training the vines on standards. Provide support for training the vines. Pods can be harvested when the grains are fully developed. Well-drained sandy or clay loams and alluviums with good fertility are generally suitable for the cultivation of the crop. If flowering coincides with rainy season, fruit set will be adversely affected. Land Preparation As waterlogging will affect germination and growth of the crop, it may be sown in raised beds during rainy season. To control the disease, provide good drainage (Refer cowpea). If the period of maturity is rain free, the crop may be left in the field for about a week after complete leaf shedding. If the period is rainy, the crop may be harvested after leaf shedding and the produce may then be dried in shade for about 10 days. Strain through muslin cloth. The starch solution drained from cooked rice (kanjivellam) can be used for this purpose. 52 SOYBEAN TUBERS ELEPHANT FOOT YAM (Amorphophallus paeoniifolius) Elephant foot yam requires fairly long growing season and a rainfall of about 150 cm during the crop period. A well-drained soil of medium texture is suited for this crop. 53 ELEPHANT FOOE YAM Tannia is suited to warm humid climate with high rainfall. But can be grown in areas of 100-200 cm rainfall, provided it is evenly distributed. It can be grown on a wide variety of soils except hard clay or pure sands, but requires a deep well drained, fertile loamy soil, preferably with a pH of 5. Season Rainfed crop : February- March to November-December. adjoining areas as a rainfed crop. Planting on ridges or mounds is often recommended since tuber formation is improved when adequate drainage is provided. Maintenance of adequate soil moisture, proper shade to sustain a humid microclimate and avoiding full exposure to sunlight is a must for good crop growth, better tuber and leaf yield. If mature cormels are not harvested, most of them will sprout at rain, become watery and less suitable for consumption. 55 XANTHOSOMA COLOCASIA  TARO  (Colocasia esculenta) Colocasia is a crop of tropical and sub-tropical regions and requires a warm humid climate. Under rainfed conditions, it requires a fairly well distributed rainfall around 120-150 cm during the growth period. Well- drained soil is suitable for uniform development of tubers. Season Rainfed crop : May-June to Oct-Nov. In the case of rainfed crop, if there is prolonged drought, supplementary irrigation is required. Temperature around 30ºC and rainfall of 120-200 cm distributed throughout the growth period are ideal. Yam requires loose, deep, well-drained, fertile soil. SWEET POTATO (Ipomoea batatas) Sweet potato requires a warm humid tropical climate with a mean temperature of about 22ºC. Under rainfed conditions the crop requires a fairly well distributed annual rainfall of 75-150 cm. The crop can be grown on a variety of soils having good drainage, but grows best in fertile sandy loam soils. Season Rainfed crop: June-July, September- October Irrigated crops: October-November (for uplands) and January- February (for low lands) Varieties Improved varieties: H-41, H-42, Sree Nandini, Sree Vardhini, Sree Rethna, Sree Bhadra, Kanjanghad, Sree Arun, Sree Varun and Sree Kanaka. Provide adequate drainage and prevent water logging. IW   CPE for higher tuber yield in non-rainy periods is 1. Under rainfed conditions, green manure crops such as kozhinjil and sunnhemp can be grown after harvest of the sweet potato and later incorporated into the soil at the time of land preparation for the succeeding crop. 61 SWEET POTATO TAPIOCA  CASSAVA  (Manihot esculenta) Tapioca grows and produces best under warm humid tropical conditions where rainfall is well distributed and fairly abundant. It can also be grown under irrigation where rainfall is low. The crop grows well in well-drained laterite, gravelly and sandy loam soils. The crop cannot survive waterlogged conditions and in such areas, it must be planted on mounds or ridges that permit drainage. Preparation of nursery: Select an area with well drained soil and irrigation facility. Irrigation Under conditions of well-distributed rainfall, tapioca grows well as a rainfed crop and irrigation is not necessary. When the crop is grown under irrigation, yield increase of 150-200 per cent over the rainfed crop has been observed. The non-trailing grain cowpea variety V-26 is recommended as a companion crop along with tapioca. A well-drained medium fertile soil is suitable for its cultivation. It grows and yield best in well-drained red sandy loams and light coastal sands. Heavy clay soils, poor drainage conditions, very low temperature and frost are unsuitable for the crop. Punch about 16-20 holes on the polythene bags to ensure good drainage. During the rainy season, damping off of young seedlings is common. These polyhouses give protection to the seedlings and grafts during heavy rains and reduce the mortality. Initial training   shape pruning The sprouts coming from the rootstock portion of the graft, that is from the portion below the graft joint, should be removed frequently during the first year of planting. Initial training and pruning of young cashew plants during the first 3-4 years is essential for providing proper shape. Initial training and pruning of cashew plants facilitate easy cultural operations such as terrace making, weeding, fertilizer application, nut collection and plant protection. Top working is simple and can be done by farmers after getting proper training. Dieback or pink disease This disease is prevalent in cashew plantations during rainy season. Remove the solution from the stove, cool, strain and then add colour (dissolved in little quantity of syrup). Cool, add colour, strain and bottle it. Remove the apples from the syrup solution, drain for 30 minutes and dry it slowly in open area by spreading in a polythene sheet. Strain the solution through muslin cloth after 21 days, again keep for 21 days and strain to get the cashew apple wine. ) Cotton is grown from sea level to moder- ate elevations not exceeding 1000 m where the climate is tropical with rainfall 500 to 750 mm.

The major rubber tract experiences a monsoon climate with annual rain fall ranging from 2000   4500 mm. Soils of the traditional belt are highly weathered and are mostly laterite and lateritic types. Rubber grows in a wide range of soils however, deep well drained soils free from underlying sheet rocks are well suited for the cultivation of rubber. Budded plants: Either poly bag or root trainer plants can be used for planting Approved cultivars The planting material recommendation of the Rubber Board is based on a multi clone concept. For cultivation under rainfed unirrigated conditions, polyclonal seedlings are the best choice. RUBBER 82 Polybag and root trainer nurseries Polybag and root trainer grown plants grow well when maintained in poly houses. Soil should be deep, well drained loam with good fertility status. Planting materials The generally used planting materials are seedling stumps, budded stumps, polybag plants and root trainer plants. Root trainer plants: The root trainer cups usually have a length of 26 cm and a holding capacity of 600 cc with vertical ridges on the inside wall and tapering with a drainage hole at the bottom. The potting medium should be packed well inside the root trainer cup before planting seeds. Root trainers are stacked in a raised bed of soil so as to facilitate tap root development. When the plants show healthy growth, the root trainer is lifted from the bed, tap root pruned near the drainage hole and stacked on stand made or iron bamboo splinters. The ridges on the side walls direct these laterals to the drainage hole which also undergoes air pruning. Thus a hardened root trainer plant consists of a dense root plug with tap root and well oriented lateral roots. Planting Planting should be done with the onset of monsoon when the weather conditions are ideal with sufficient rains. In order to reduce erosion further and to facilitate rain water infiltration trenches of about 120 cm length, 45 cm width and 60 cm depth are taken along with contour in between the planting rows. Drainage: Proper drainage is essential especially on low-lying lands. The natural 85 RUBBER waterways existing in the plantation may be cleared or deepened to give adequate drainage. If drains are cut, uniform depth should be maintained throughout. Root trainer plants: At the time of planting, the root plug can be separated from the container without any damage by inverting it and giving a gentle tap of the rim of the root trainer on any hard surface. A planting hole can be made in the refilled planting pit by pressing the empty root trainer container into soil. The root trainer plants show early establishment due to its well-developed root system. Herbicide spraying is most effective when done during sunny weather and in the absence of wind. However, heavy rainfall period should be avoided to minimize runoff and leaching losses. The normal recommended CUT practice in India is periodic panel changing ie, basal panel tapping (S 2) with rain guard during rainy season, and CUT (S 4) on high panel during non-rainy season. Rain guarding A suitable device is fixed on the trunk just above the tapping cut and flow of water through the main trunk is channeled out. This method is found to be effective to keep the tapping cut and the bark below and above in dry condition during the rainy season. Chances of bark rot are high when the trees are rain guarded and tapping is continued during rainy season. Irrespective of the type of rain guard used, regular panel washing using fungicide (mancozeb 0. With the introduction of Low Frequency Tapping, rain guarding is needed even under low rainfall conditions. Types of rain guards recommended are polythene skirt, tapping shade and Guardian Kissan rain guard. ) Symptoms During rainy season, when trees are tapped, depressions are formed in the tapping panel due to localized rotting and drying of bark. RUBBER 92 SUGARCANE (Saccharum officinarum) Sugarcane grows best in the tropical regions, receiving a rainfall of 750-1200 mm. The soils should be well drained. In hilly tracts where sugarcane is cultivated under rainfed conditions, planting should be done after abatement of heavy rains. Irrigation Irrigate the crop 8-10 times depending upon the availability of rains. Water should not be let into a healthy crop from diseased areas and as far as possible, the field may be kept free of standing water by providing drainage channels. 95 SUGARCANE Coconut requires an equatorial climate with high humidity. A well-distributed rainfall of 1300-2300 mm per annum is preferred. 5 m depth) well drained soil. Hybrids Anandaganga, Keraganga and Kerasankara are recommended for general cultivation both under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Kalpamithra is recommended for rainfed conditions. Selection and preparation of site for nursery Nursery sites should be well drained with light textured soil and with adequate but not too much shade. In areas where drainage is poor, prepare raised beds. If the soil is sandy, provide mulching immediately after the cessation of monsoon rain. On slopes and in areas of undulating terrain, prepare the land by contour terracing or bunding. In lateritic gravelly soils, under rainfed conditions of north Kerala, a closer spacing to accommodate 250 palms per ha is more economical. Time of planting Planting the seedlings during May, with the onset of pre-monsoon rains is ideal. In low-lying areas, plant the seedlings in September after the cessation of heavy rains. Manuring young palms For the first three years after planting under rainfed conditions, apply fertilizers in two split doses at the rates shown in Table 23. 00 (b) For rainfed conditions 0. In level lands, during rainy seasons excess water may be conserved in small trenches dug out in the plantation. This will facilitate maximum percolation of rainwater and water conservation. 0m from the base of the palm for green manure during April-May with the onset of pre- monsoon rains. Sow green manure and cover crop seeds during April-May with the onset of pre- monsoon rains. Tephrosia is especially suited for planting around seedling pits for summer shade and as a source of green manure in the rainy season. Time, frequency and method of fertilizer application Under rainfed conditions, apply fertilizers in two split doses, 1 3 at the time of early southwest monsoon showers in April-June and 2 3 in September-October. Some of the major advantages of drip irrigation are: it saves water, enhances plant growth and yield, saves energy and labour, most suited for soils having low water holding capacity and undulating terrain, reduces weed growth and improves efficiency of fertilizers. Apply Bordeaux paste and protect it from rain till normal shoot emerges. When it rains, a small quantity of the fungicide is released from the sachets to the leaf base, thus protecting the palm. Provide adequate drainage in gardens. Under rainfed conditions, apply fertilizers in two splits, 1 3rd at the time of early southwest monsoon and 2 3rd before the northeast monsoon. Among these ham beetle, Necrobia rufipes and saw toothed grain beetle, Oryzaphilus surinamensis are of major importance, which can cause more than 15 per cent loss to copra when stored for more than six months.

Tikka leaf spot disease infects both the rainfed and irrigated crops. It can be grown in areas, which receive well-distributed annual rainfall of 200 cm or more. The oil is then drained out. SESAME (Sesamum indicum) Sesame grows in well-drained, sandy loam soils. 5  Thilarani Suited to summer rice fallows of Onattukara SESAME 116 Irrigation Usually the crop is grown under rainfed conditions. It is grown in areas where the annual rainfall ranges from 1500-4000 mm with a temperature range of 10-35 ºC and an altitude of 600-1200 m above MSL. The crop is raised mainly on well drained, deep, good textured soils rich in humus. ISSR Vijetha is resistant to Katte disease and is recommended to moderate rainfall with moderate to high shaded mosaic (cardamom mosaic virus) infected areas. The site is selected in open, gently slopping and well-drained areas near a source of water. Provide overhead pandal as in the case of seedling nursery and remove shading material with onset of monsoon rains. Planting can be done with the commence- ment of southwest monsoon, before the heavy rains. Soil conservation measures, maintenance of drainage channels and such other operations may be taken up promptly. The present recommendation of nutrients for cardamom in Kerala under rainfed situation is N:P2O5:K2O   75:75:150 kg ha-1. By regulating the shade before the monsoon, more light becomes available to the plant during the rainy season. It sheds the leaves during rainy season and thus provides natural shade regulation. Insecticide application can be skipped during rainy months of June and July. occurring during the rainy season. Spray the shoots with 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture with adhesive (rosin soda or any other sticker) by the commencement of the monsoon and continue the spraying operation two or three times up to November- December according to the intensity of the disease and rainfall. 1  Fosetyl  Al (3-5 l  plant) and repeat this at monthly interval depending the intensity of the disease and rainfall. Prophylactic application of the biocontrol agent Pseudomonas fluorescens (two percent spray) along with basal application of Mycorrhiza (100 g) and Trichoderma viride (50 g) per plant by the commencement of the monsoon and continue the spraying operation monthly depending on the intensity of the disease and rainfall. The disease occurs during non rainy seasons. Humid tropical evergreen rain forest conditions favour the best growth of cinnamon. Well-drained, deep sandy soil, rich in humus is suitable for the crop. On the lower surface of the lesions ash coloured white superficial growth of the fungus appears during moist weather conditions. Dig the pits sufficiently early to allow weathering. The lower grades are exported as: (a) Quillings: The broken lengths and 125 CINNAMON CLOVE (Syzygium aromaticum) Clove requires a warm humid tropical climate with an annual rainfall from 150-250 cm. Deep loam soils with high humus content and black loams of semi-forest regions with good drainage are fragments of quills of all grades are bulked and sold as quillings; (b) Featherings: This grade consists of the inner bark of twigs and twisted shoots that do not give straight quills of normal length. Spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture during rainy season controls the disease. Allow to weather. Plant the seedlings during the rainy season, May-June or August-September. In sunny weather, drying is completed in 4-5 days giving a bright coloured dried spice of attractive appearance. Shedding of flower buds occur during periods of heavy and continuous rainfall. CLOVE 128 VANILLA (Vanilla planifolia) Vanilla is a tropical orchid requiring a warm climate with frequent rains, preferring an annual rainfall of 150-300 cm. Plant the cutting with the onset of monsoon rains. If allowed to remain on the vine further, 129 VANILLA GINGER (Zingiber officinale) Ginger is a tropical plant adapted for cultivation even in regions of subtropical climate such as the high ranges. The crop cannot withstand waterlogging and hence soils with good drainage are preferred for its cultivation. Provide drainage channels, one for every 25 beds on flat lands. Select sites having proper drainage. 133 GINGER AND MANGO GINGER MANGO GINGER (Curcuma amada) It is an under exploited spice crop, which grows luxuriantly in tropical soils with good drainage. The rhizomes and roots are carminative and stomachic and in crushed pulp form they are applied over contusions, sprains and bruises for rapid healing. The crop comes up well in open conditions, but tolerates low levels of NUTMEG (Myristica fragrans) Nutmeg requires a hot, humid climate without pronounced dry season. The soil should be rich in organic matter and well drained. BLACK PEPPER (Piper nigrum) Pepper requires a warm and humid climate. Though an annual rainfall of 250 cm is ideal for the proper growth of the crop, it can also come up well in low rainfall areas, if the pattern and distribution of rainfall are conducive. About 70 mm of rainfall within a period of 20 days may be sufficient for triggering of flushing and flowering process in the plant, but once the process is set on, there should be continuous, rainfall until fruit development starts. Very long spells of dry weather are unfavourable for the crop growth. The disease can be NUTMEG AND BLACK PEPPER 136 controlled by spraying 1 per cent Bordeaux mixture two or three times during rainy season. Pepper prefers a light porous and well- drained soil rich in organic matter. So, heavy textured soils in locations where drainage facilities are inadequate should be avoided. Selection of site Sites with slight to moderate slope are ideal for pepper cultivation, as they promote drainage. When polythene bags are used, sufficient number of holes (16-20) may be provided at the base to ensure good drainage. Provide shade to the plants if the land is exposed and if there is a break in the rainfall. Management after planting If the terrain of the land is sloppy or uneven, carry out contour bunding or terracing to prevent soil erosion. Prune and train the standards in March- April every year to remove excessive overgrowth and to give them a proper shape. The fertilizers may be applied in two split doses, the first in May-June with the receipt of a few soaking rains and the second in August-September. Wherever water stagnation is a problem, effective drainage of both surface and sub-soil is to be ensured. Remove shade as soon as continuous rain sets in. Berries are thoroughly cleaned in water, steeped in saturated brine solution for 2-3 months, drained and packed in suitable flexible polyethylene pouches. Pepper oleoresin Extraction of black pepper with organic solvents like acetone, ethanol or dichloro-ethane 145 BLACK PEPPER TURMERIC (Curcuma longa) Turmeric is a tropical herb and can be grown on different types of soil under irrigated and rainfed conditions. Rich loamy soils having good drainage are ideal for the crop. The cooked rhizomes are taken out of the pan by lifting the trough and draining the solution into the pan. 1mm ) TAMARIND (Tamarindus indica) The tree is particularly well adapted to semi- arid tropical regions, but can be grown in heavy rainfall areas too, provided the soil is well drained. It grows well from almost sea level up to an altitude of 1000 m in areas of abundant and well-distributed rainfall or under irrigated conditions. Varieties Mangala, Sumangala, Sreemangala and Mohitnagar, VTLAH1, VTLAH2 Selection of site Select sites with deep well drained soil without high water table. Provide irrigation during hot and dry periods and drainage during monsoon. The planting is to be done during May-June in well-drained soils and during August-September in clayey soils. Under rainfed conditions, apply the second dose during March-April after the receipt of summer rains. Irrigation and drainage Irrigate the palms during hot and dry periods at regular intervals depending upon the soil type. Construct drainage channels (25-30 cm deep from the bottom of pits) between the rows and drain out water during periods of heavy rainfall to prevent waterlogging. Sow seeds of green manure-cum- cover crops such as Mimosa invisa, Stylosanthes gracilis and Calapagonium muconoides in April-May with the onset of pre-monsoon rains. Converted paddy fields   Provide deep drainage channels so as to keep the water below the root zone during monsoon. Band disease Improve soil conditions by loosening hard soil strata, if present, by providing good drainage. Collar rot of seedlings Improve drainage conditions in nursery beds and gardens. Improvement of drainage and root feeding of 125 ml tridemorph (1. Improvement of drainage in ill drained gardens and spraying of borax   2 g l-1 of water are found effective in reducing the disease incidence. 250 - 155 ARECANUT Betel vine requires a tropical climate with high atmospheric humidity. The crop grows best on well-drained fertile soils. An annual rainfall ranging from 200 to 450 cm is ideal. In the absence of rain, light irrigation, four times daily, is given till establishment. Irrigation and drainage Betel vine needs constantly moist soil, but there should not be excessive moisture. If waterlogging by heavy rains or excess irrigation occurs, drainage should be arranged immediately. 157 BETEL VINE COCOA (Theobroma cacao) The cocoa tree flourishes in the dense shade of warm rain forests in its natural habitat and hence can be cultivated in all similar climatic conditions. The crop requires well- distributed rainfall. The minimum requirement of rainfall is about 100-150cm per annum. Pits of 50 cm x 50 cm x 50 cm are dug, allowed to weather for one month and refilled with topsoil and 15-20 kg of compost or FYM to ground level. Pruning and training Cocoa grows in a series of storeys, the chupon or vertical growth of the seedling terminating at the jorquette from where four to five fan branches develop. Irrigation Cocoa grows well as a rainfed crop under conditions of well distributed rainfall and irrigation is not necessary. If sufficient moisture is not present in the soil due to prolonged drought or failure of rains, irrigation is to be given once in five days. Though top working can be done in all seasons, it is preferable to do it in rain-free period in irrigated gardens. For rainfed situations, it may preferably be done after the receipt of pre- monsoon showers. Rain-proof preparations are to be used. Improve drainage and adjust shade. Provide proper drainage and regulate shade to increase aeration. The discards at the harvest can be left in the garden either in the open during summer or in pits at different sites in the rainy season or they can be incorporated in the compost. The baskets are lined with one or two layers of torn banana leaves to facilitate drainage of sweatings. Weather changes and season are important through their influence on temperature and atmospheric moisture. Under normal sunny weather, drying can be completed in four to five days. ) The soil and climatic requirements for Arabica and Robusta varieties are as follows: Arabica Elevation : 1000-1500 m above MSL Annual rainfall : 1600-2500 mm Blossom rain : March-April (2. 0 cm) Backing rain : April-May (5-7. 5 cm) Shade : Medium to light Temperature : 15-25ºC RH : 70-80 per cent Robusta Elevation : 500-1000 m above MSL Annual rainfall : 1000-2000 mm Blossom rain : Feb-March (2. 0 cm) Backing rain : April-May (5-7.

Level the land into an even slope to facilitate easy cultural operations and proper drainage. Training of young tea Proper training of young tea is essential to encourage good spread of the bushes, proper development of frames and high density of plucking points. Centering should be done 4-6 months after planting during humid weather when there is adequate moisture in the soil. They are dry weather pests mostly attacking mature foliage except pink and yellow mites. The predisposing factors for the disease are deep planting, planting in gravelly soils, mulching closer to collar, wounds caused by weeding implements, fertilizer application close to collar, pegging, low moisture status in bark and surface watering during dry weather. Stem Tobacco is generally raised as a cold weather crop, the optimum temperature range being 18 to 27ºC. The crop prefers well-drained fertile soil. Do not let in irrigation water or drainage water from infested fields. Avoid sowing or planting of red leaved varieties during periods of heavy rain. During rainy season planting shall be done on raised beds. Conduct weeding regularly and earth up rows during rainy season. For the rainfed crop, sowing can be started after the receipt of first few showers during May-June. Earthing up is done during rainy season. Diseases Downy mildew It is severe during rainy season.

Ensure good drainage and prevent water logging. Apply lime   1 kg pit-1 and allow to weather. BANANA 214 GUAVA (Psidium guajava) Guava thrives well in places receiving medium rainfall not exceeding 100 cm. In heavy rainfall areas, plants grow luxuriantly, but produce insipid and low quality friuts. Red sandy loam soil with good drainage is the most ideal for commercial cultivation of guava. Plant protection Fruit rot disease This is a serious disease of guava especially during rainy season. It prefers a warm dry climate and is found in the dry deciduous forests of Kerala. However, a high yielding larger fruited variety was located from the rain shadow region of the Western Ghats and popularized as  Chambakad Large. One year old seedlings can be planted in the field during rainy season at a spacing of 8 m x 8 m. Soil should be deep and well drained. Excellent drainage and adequate watering result in better performance. It is grown in regions having good drainage. After cultivation Give a light digging or ploughing when the rains start. MANGO (Mangifera indica) Mango is adaptable to a wide range of climate and soil conditions and grows well from sea level up to about 1500 m above mean sea level. It withstands both fairly dry conditions and heavy rainfall. Season Plant one year old grafts with the onset of monsoon showers so that they get established before the rains. If rainfall is heavy, planting should be done during August-September. Prepare pits of size 1 m x 1 m x 1 m at a spacing of 9 m, one month before planting and allow to weather. 0 g   tree, Time of application : September avoiding rainy periods Method of application: Dilute in 10 litres of water and drench soil at about 60 cm away from tree trunk. PAPAYA (Carica papaya) Papaya thrives well in tropical climate. In Kerala, the limiting factors for commercial cultivation are high rainfall and severe drought in summer. The papaya prefers a rich, well-drained soil. Seed beds should be watered daily, if there is no rain. Two hand diggings, one in the beginning of the rainy season and another in January- February are necessary. Collar rot or stem rot Waterlogging and poor drainage are the chief contributing factors. They can be grown with a wide range of rainfall from 600-2500 mm  annum, the optimum being 1000-1500 mm. Planting should be avoided during the periods of heavy rains. Note: In places where rains are scanty during November, N and K2O may be applied in three equal splits - two doses in 1st year (May-June and August-September) and the third in May-June of the second year. Avoid periods of heavy rainfall for spraying. 04 per cent calcium carbonate as follows: The mixture (50 ml plant) is to be applied pouring into the heart of 10-12 months old plants (39-42 leaf stage) during dry weather. Season Main season of planting is April-May and August-September, but can also be planted in all months except during heavy rain of June- July. Hence it is important to provide good drainage, if grown in wetlands. In paddy lands, pineapple is planted in paired rows at 45 cm x 30 cm spacing on ridges taken at 60-90 cm height, depending on the water table and drainage requirement. The ridges are separated by drainage channels having 60 cm width. Wherever water stagnation and poor drainage are expected, a wider and deeper channel is given in between ridges. Intercropping Vegetables and tuber crops can be grown as rainfed intercrops. Spraying should be done in moist soil, but avoid rainy periods. Pour 50 ml of the prepared solution to the heart of the plant during dry weather conditions (when there is no rain during the time of application). is common in poor drainage conditions. Providing drainage is most essential. It can be grown in all types of soil, but well drained soil is necessary for good growth. Planting should be avoided during the periods of heavy rains. Irrigation Irrigation may not be necessary except during the early stages and in the hot weather; but good crops can be obtained with irrigation. Training and pruning No pruning is necessary; but in old trees, lower branches can be removed up to 1 m height. It is a medium sized shrub, which thrives well in tropical climate. It is best suited as a homestead fruit crop and prefers a rich well drained soil. Slop- ing sites to allow free drainage are considered more suitable than level tops. The ideal soil types are loam, sandy loam and silt loam with open porous and well-drained subsoil. Pruning Pruning and training are important in apple cultivation. Pruning of older leaves, removal of suckers at young stage, cleaning of crown before rains etc. Soil and climate Jasmine can be planted on a wide range of soils. Well-drained sandy loams and red loams are ideal for its cultivation. They give good yield in low rainfall conditions. Deep well-drained acidic soils with a pH of 5.

A heavy irrigation once in 5-10 days is necessary depending upon the weather conditions. Soil A wide range of soils with good drainage is suitable for cultivation of marigold. Harvest and yield Crossandra flowers within two to three months after planting and continues to bear flowers throughout the year with a lean production season during rainy months. Soil Though it could be cultivated on a wide range of soils, well-drained red loamy soil is ideal. Irrigate once in 4-6 days depending upon soil moisture and weather conditions. In poorly drained soils, foot rot caused by Phytophthora may occur. The crop has to be irrigated once in 4-5 days depending upon the soil and weather conditions. High humidity and plenty of rainfall are conducive to its luxuriant growth. Take pits of size 45 cm x 45 cm x 45 cm at a spacing 2 m x 2 m at least one month prior to planting and allow to weather. Kacholam is a plant adapted for tropical climate. Fertile loamy soil having good drainage is ideal for the crop. Plant protection During heavy rains, leaf rot disease occurs in certain localities. KACHOLAM 240 LEMONGRASS (Cymbopogon flexuosus) Lemongrass prefers warm climate with a well-distributed rainfall and well-drained soil. Lem- ongrass is a perennial grass mainly cultivated on hill slopes as a rainfed crop. Seeds are sown in well prepared nursery beds during April-May with the onset of pre-monsoon rains and covered with thin layer of soil. On sloppy terrain, the beds are formed along the contours. During the first year of planting, three cuttings are obtained and subsequently five to six cuttings per year are taken subject to weather conditions. LEMONGRASS AND PALMAROSA 242 Vetiver is a perennial grass, commonly known as  khus  and mainly cultivated on hill slopes as a rainfed crop. It prefers a warm climate and grows in areas up to 600 m elevation. Even though vetiver grows almost in all soils, a rich and fairly well drained sandy loam is the best.

It is restricted to elevations below 500 m but it withstands variations in rainfall, sunlight, windstorm, slight frost and drought. It requires a deep well drained neutral soil and can tolerate saline and acid soil. It can also be grown in steep slopes, hilly terrains, gravelly areas and sandy loams. Planting of seedlings can be done with the onset of rains in May-June or September- October. Rainfed crop yields about 35-45 t ha-1 of green fodder whereas the yield will be increased to about 50-100 t ha-1 under irrigated conditions. Give irrigation if there is no rain. In gravelly soil and in low rainfall areas, a yield of 25-30 tonnes per ha per year may be obtained. 267 SUBABUL, HEDGE LUCERNE AND AGATHI FODDER LEGUMES FODDER COWPEA (Vigna unguiculata) Cowpea is the most important leguminous fodder crop suitable for both summer and rainy seasons, mainly due to its quick growing habit and high yielding ability. The plant cannot withstand frost, excessive and prolonged waterlogging, while some varieties are resistant to heavy rains. In Kerala, it is raised as a rainfed crop during May and also as summer crop in rice fallows. It is adapted to the moist tropics with annual rainfall in excess of 1000 mm. For rainfed crop, at the time of land preparation, FYM   10 t ha-1 is applied and basal application of N, P2O5 and K2O   25, 60 and 30 kg ha-1 is recommended. The grains are used as human food as well as animal feed. The crop is suited for growing in warm, humid tropical climate. It can be cultivated in areas receiving less than 1000 mm of rainfall and in less fertile soil, acid soils, gravelly sandy soils and also in ill-drained soils. It does not tolerate shade and can grow very well in areas receiving 900 to 4000 mm of rainfall. Although Stylo is usually nodulated by naturally occurring Rhizobium strains, these however, will not be as effective as the commercial strains. Seeds are sown broadcast and covered with thin layer of soil or dibbled at a spacing of 30 cm STYLO 270 FODDER CEREALS FODDER MAIZE (Zea mays) Maize grows best in warm climate where the day temperature is fairly light. Heavy rains and dry hot winds are not suitable. Favourable annual rainfall is 60-100 cm. The crop comes up well in soils with good drainage and fair moisture status. This crop adapts to varying conditions of soil and climate. FODDERV SORGHUM AND GREEN MANURE CROPS 272 GREEN LEAF MANURE CROPS Gliricidia (Gliricidia maculata) It is a shrub, which takes up a tree habit under favourable conditions of soil and climate. The procedure involves soaking the entire quantity of seeds in cold (room temperature) water in the evening and draining the water next morning, followed by drying the seeds under shade during the day. Planting practices Containerised stock (commonly in polybags, but also in root trainers) is planted in pits (15- 20 cm cube) at 2 m x 2 m spacing with the onset of rains, in the case of monospecific woodlots. Planting is done immediately after the first rain. One or two weeding is done immediately after the rains. grandis grows best in deep, permanently moist, well-drained soils. tereticornis also prefers moist and well-drained soils such as loamy sands or alluvial loams, with high nutrient availability. Planting stock Three-month-old containerized stock (polybag seedlings or root trainer seedlings) is recommended for planting. The seedlings should be pricked out when they have two pairs of leaves into polybags of size 22 cm x 10 cm or root trainers. Planting and stand management Best time for planting is the beginning of rains. Mangium shows most vigorous growth on well-drained, fertile soils in high rainfall areas ( 2000 mm annually) in the humid tropics. Seed inoculation with appropriate rhizobial strain is recommended before sowing. It prefers a warm moist tropical climate with mean annual precipitation of 1100-2000 mm and a well-drained fertile soil. Teak seedlings can be produced in shorter duration by using polythene bags or root trainers. Three- month-old root trainer seedlings are also popular, of late. If containerized planting stock (polybags, root trainer) is used, then optimal time of planting may be after the onset of southwest monsoon in June-July. As preventive measures against this disease, maintain proper drainage and avoid root injury. Planting should be carried out immediately before the rainy season. It is necessary that cuttings should leave at least one node above the ground to prevent rainwater soaking into the rhizome. Seeds are sown in raised nursery beds during rainy season. Wind dispersed seeds will germinate in the early part of the rainy season. It thrives best on well drained, deep, moist soil, particularly in the neighbourhood of perennial streams. Places where average annual rainfall is about 700-1600 mm is best suited for its growth. It is fragrant, heavy, narrowly interlocked grained and medium coarse textured. This method is practiced usually in shrubby areas, where sprouting seedlings are well protected during rainy season. Heavy rainfall and properly drained and aerated soil are necessary for its growth. If there is no rainfall, regular watering is essential. Natural regeneration Seen in forests by germination of wind dispersed seeds during rainy season. Grows well in places where annual rainfall is above 1000 mm and atmosphere is hot as well as humid. Abundant growth occurs in places with average annual rainfall of 1500-5000 mm and in fertile laterite soil. It grows to about 36 m height and attains a diameter of about 4 m if the climate is favourable. Though the tree can grow in almost all types of soils, laterite soil with proper drainage is best suited. Even though they grow in almost all types of soil, good drainage is essential. Regions having rainfall 75-200 cm is best suited. PUNNA AND AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM 294 AGRO-ECOLOGICAL ZONES OF KERALA Agricultural productivity and agro- biodiversity of an area are largely governed by the overhead climate and qualities of land and soil. The Planning Commission, consequent to a mid-term appraisal of the planning targets of the VII Plan (1985-1990), divided the country into 15 broad agro-climatic zones based on physiography and climate. The process emphasized development of resources and their optimum utilization in a sustainable manner within the framework of resource constraints and potentials of each region. Accordingly a map of 127 subzones was prepared, based primarily on rainfall, existing cropping patterns and administrative units. 1) Northern zone 2) Southern zone 3) Central zone 4) High altitude zone 5) Onattukara zone 6) Kuttanad and Kole zone 7) Pokkali zone, and 8) Low rainfall zone Kerala Agricultural University revised the NARP delineation of agro-ecological subzones to generate an Agro-ecological Zones Map of the state (Kerala Agricultural University, 2007). The basis of spatial delineations was variability in altitude, rainfall pattern, soil type and topography. , 1992) by integrating climate, physiography, length of growing period and soils, an improvement on the agro-climatic zone map of the Planning Commission which considered only physiography and climate for delineation of zones.

Mass multiplication of earthworms Earthworms can be multiplied in 1:1 mixture of cowdung and decaying leaves in a cement tank or wooden box or plastic bucket with proper drainage facilities. The isolates of Azospirillum brasilense strains AZR 15 and AZR 37 from Kuttanad soils are highly effective for rice, vegetables and nursery plants. For acidic upland soils, ammoniacal fertilizers are most suitable during rainy season since ammonium is adsorbed on soil particles and hence leaching losses are reduced. In alkaline upland soils of low rainfall regions, nitrate fertilizers are preferred to ammoniacal fertilizers or urea since ammonia may be lost by volatilization under alkaline conditions. In coarse textured soils and in heavy rainfall regions, potassium fertilizers should be applied in as many splits as possible, to reduce loss of potassium. In case of wetland rice, drain the field prior to lime application and reflood after 24 hours. Flushing the soil by sequential flooding and draining will help to wash out the displaced acid from the soil. The hives should be preferably painted white on outside to protect the timber from weathering. Location of beehives The apiary must be located in well-drained open area, preferably near orchards, with profuse source of nectar, pollen and water. The colonies must be directed towards east, with slight changes in the directions of the bee box as a protection from rain and sun. Its growth depends on many climatic conditions such as temperature, humidity, rainfall etc. A temperature range of 24-28ºC, humidity range of 65-80 per cent and 600-2500 mm rainfall are ideal for optimum growth of mulberry.

The cut crop is fully conveyed into the threshing unit and the cleaned grain is temporarily stored in the grain tank of about 1 tonne capacity. The threshed and cleaned grain can be collected in gunny bags which are held at the sack holder of the machine. Machines with grain tank are also available. Then squeeze the tobacco waste and remove all debris by filtering the extract through a muslin cloth or a strainer. The addition of the sticker is particularly recommended for spraying conducted during rainy season. APPENDIX 8 356 Appendix 9 FUMIGANTS AND ITS USE (For restricted use only) Aluminium phosphide Aluminium phosphide can be used for fumigating rat burrows and for control of pests infesting stored grains. For fumigating grains and grain products under cover, use aluminium phosphide   1-2 tablets per tonne of grains, giving an exposure period of 5 days followed by aeration for a day. 1kg seed to be presoaked in 1 litre of ZnSO4 suspension for 24 hours, drain and keep for sprouting. Application of magnesium as basal dose   20 kg MgO ha is effective in giving significant increase in grain and straw yield of rice in magnesium deficient soils.

Intercrops should be selected based on slope of the land, light availability in the plantation and marketability. Cardamom capsules with green colour fetch a premium price in foreign countries. Decorticated seeds   seed powder Decorticated seeds command a lower price due to rapid loss of volatile oil during storage and transportation. Seed powder is marketed to a limited extent. The infested capsules are light in weight, inferior in quality and fetch very low price in the market. Oil can also be distilled from white pepper but high price of white pepper and low oil yield do not favour its commercial production. The extract obtained from the mature fruit rind, (-) hydroxy citric acid, attracts foreign markets, for its use in medicines controlling obesity. The treated leaves should be consumed marketed after thorough washing in water. MAURITIUS Mauritius is recommended for commercial cultivation for table purposes and distant marketing, due to its shorter duration, better fruit quality, keeping quality and transportability. For getting maximum price and better keeping quality, the best planting time is April-May. Free flowering habit, short duration to produce marketable flowers, wide spectrum of colour, shape, size and good keeping quality make marigold an acceptable commercial crop. Clean the dried produce, bag and store in cool dry place or market it. After digging out, the root tubers are cleaned by washing in water and marketed. The rhizomes with attached tubers are usually marketed afresh. The cleaned rhizomes are either marketed or dried and stored. Separate the roots, clean the rhizomes and cut into 5 cm long pieces, which are dried in the sun for 3-5 days to 10 per cent moisture for marketing. It is available in the market in two forms. Rhizomes are sliced to 1cm size, dried in sun and marketed or stored in gunny bags. Dried mature female spikes are commercially marketed. The cleaned rhizomes are either marketed or dried and stored. The marketing is done in fresh form as well as after drying depending on the fluctuation of price in the market. The fresh form is marketed immediately after harvest. About 75 per cent of the selling price of a sandal tree goes to its owner. The wood is durable, attractive and has high demand in the market. Vermicompost Vermitechnology is a process by which all types of biodegradable wastes such as farm wastes, kitchen wastes, market wastes, biowastes of agro-based industries, livestock wastes etc. The cocoons are collected from Chandrika and transported in light gunny bags to cocoon market. The cocoon should be marketed immediately after harvest, so as to avoid adult emergence. Dry prawn available in the market is heated and powdered. Harvesting must be done at the appropriate maturity depending up on the marketing distances and purpose. Grading the produce can improve market acceptability. Grading will also increase farmer s bargaining power, as they are likely to get premium prices for better- grade products. Using evaporative cool chamber constructed to store temporarily the harvested produce at the field before marketing. Off season production of vegetables is also possible in greenhouse which fetches a high market price to the farmer.

The tips of leaves get rolled longitudinally into needle like outgrowths and turn whitish. In advanced stages, the tips and margins of the leaflets dry and shrivel giving a burnt appearance. Common symptoms are necrosis of leaf tips and margins, narrowing of leaves, thickening of veins, reduction of internodal length and rosetting. The affected branches stand without leaves or only with young leaves at the tips. Later splits develop at the tips, which extend longitudinally exposing the kernel. Con- trol of pests of vegetables with the help of non- chemical insecticides and tips for vegetable seed production are also given under seperate titles. To check the height of the plant and to get frequent harvests, the tips are clipped off intermittently. 203 MINOR VEGETABLES AND TIPS FOR VEGETABLE SEED PRODUCTION TIPS FOR VEGETABLE SEED PRODUCTION General principles The seed production programme envi-sages to produce genetically pure quality seeds and to store them in a viable condition for a reasonable period of time, until it reaches the farmers.
