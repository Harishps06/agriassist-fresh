Soil Management and Fertility in Kerala

SOIL TYPES IN KERALA:
- Laterite Soil: Red, high iron content, good for rubber
- Alluvial Soil: River valleys, good for rice
- Forest Soil: Rich in organic matter, good for spices
- Coastal Soil: Sandy, good for coconut
- Hill Soil: Rocky, good for tea and coffee

SOIL TESTING:
- Test every 2-3 years
- Check pH, NPK levels
- Test for micronutrients
- Check organic matter content
- Test for heavy metals

PH MANAGEMENT:
- Ideal pH: 6.0-7.0
- Acidic soil: Add lime (2-3 tons/hectare)
- Alkaline soil: Add sulfur or gypsum
- Test pH every year
- Adjust based on crop requirements

ORGANIC MATTER IMPROVEMENT:
- Add FYM: 25-30 tons/hectare
- Green manure: Sunhemp, Dhaincha
- Compost: 10-15 tons/hectare
- Vermicompost: 5-10 tons/hectare
- Crop residues: Incorporate after harvest

NITROGEN MANAGEMENT:
- Sources: Urea, DAP, organic manure
- Application: Split application
- Timing: Before planting, during growth
- Rate: 100-150 kg/hectare
- Loss prevention: Deep placement

PHOSPHORUS MANAGEMENT:
- Sources: DAP, SSP, bone meal
- Application: Basal application
- Timing: At planting time
- Rate: 50-75 kg/hectare
- Availability: Better in neutral pH

POTASSIUM MANAGEMENT:
- Sources: MOP, SOP, wood ash
- Application: Split application
- Timing: Before planting, during growth
- Rate: 50-100 kg/hectare
- Deficiency: Yellow leaf margins

MICRONUTRIENTS:
- Zinc: 5-10 kg/hectare
- Boron: 1-2 kg/hectare
- Manganese: 2-5 kg/hectare
- Iron: Foliar spray if deficient
- Copper: 1-2 kg/hectare

WATER MANAGEMENT:
- Drainage: Essential for most crops
- Irrigation: Based on crop needs
- Water conservation: Mulching, drip irrigation
- Water quality: Test for salts and pH
- Rainwater harvesting: Store for dry season

SOIL CONSERVATION:
- Contour farming: On slopes
- Terracing: For hilly areas
- Cover crops: Prevent erosion
- Windbreaks: Reduce wind erosion
- Crop rotation: Maintain soil health

COMPOST MAKING:
- Materials: Kitchen waste, crop residues, leaves
- Ratio: 2:1 (brown:green)
- Moisture: 50-60%
- Turning: Every 2-3 weeks
- Time: 2-3 months
- Use: 5-10 tons/hectare

VERMICOMPOST:
- Worms: Eudrilus eugeniae
- Bedding: Cow dung, leaves
- Moisture: 60-70%
- Temperature: 20-30°C
- Harvest: 45-60 days
- Use: 2-5 tons/hectare

CROP ROTATION:
- Rice → Vegetables → Legumes
- Coconut → Banana → Vegetables
- Spices → Green manure → Spices
- Benefits: Break pest cycles, improve soil

ORGANIC FARMING:
- No chemical fertilizers
- Use organic inputs only
- Maintain soil health
- Crop diversity
- Natural pest control
- Certification required
