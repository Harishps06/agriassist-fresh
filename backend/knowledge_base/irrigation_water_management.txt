Irrigation and Water Management in Kerala

WATER SOURCES IN KERALA:
- Rivers: Periyar, Bharathapuzha, Pamba
- Wells: Open wells, bore wells
- Tanks: Traditional water storage
- Ponds: Village level storage
- Rainwater: Primary source during monsoon

IRRIGATION METHODS:

SURFACE IRRIGATION:
- Flood Irrigation: For rice fields
- Furrow Irrigation: For row crops
- Border Irrigation: For field crops
- Basin Irrigation: For tree crops

DRIP IRRIGATION:
- Water efficiency: 90-95%
- Suitable for: Vegetables, fruits, spices
- Components: Main line, sub-main, laterals, emitters
- Pressure: 1-2 kg/cm²
- Flow rate: 2-8 liters/hour

SPRINKLER IRRIGATION:
- Water efficiency: 80-85%
- Suitable for: All crops
- Components: Pump, pipes, sprinklers
- Pressure: 2-3 kg/cm²
- Coverage: 10-15 meter radius

MICRO IRRIGATION:
- Drip + Sprinkler combination
- High efficiency: 95%
- Suitable for: High-value crops
- Cost: Higher initial investment
- Maintenance: Regular cleaning required

WATER REQUIREMENTS:

RICE CULTIVATION:
- Total water: 1000-1500mm
- Growing season: 120-150 days
- Water depth: 2-5 cm during growth
- Critical stages: Tillering, flowering
- Drainage: 15 days before harvest

COCONUT CULTIVATION:
- Young palms: 40-50 liters/week
- Bearing palms: 200-300 liters/week
- Frequency: 2-3 times per week
- Method: Basin irrigation
- Mulching: Reduce water needs

VEGETABLE CULTIVATION:
- Water needs: 500-800mm
- Frequency: Daily for young plants
- Method: Drip irrigation preferred
- Timing: Early morning or evening
- Avoid: Midday watering

SPICE CULTIVATION:
- Water needs: 1000-1200mm
- Frequency: 2-3 times per week
- Method: Drip or sprinkler
- Shade: Reduces water needs
- Mulching: Conserves moisture

WATER CONSERVATION:

RAINWATER HARVESTING:
- Roof collection: 1000 sq ft = 1000 liters
- Storage tanks: 5000-10000 liters
- Groundwater recharge: Percolation pits
- Community tanks: Village level
- Government schemes: Subsidies available

MULCHING:
- Materials: Dry leaves, straw, plastic
- Benefits: Reduces evaporation
- Thickness: 5-10 cm
- Coverage: 80-90% of soil surface
- Replacement: Every 2-3 months

COVER CROPS:
- Legumes: Fix nitrogen, add organic matter
- Grasses: Prevent erosion
- Mixtures: Multiple benefits
- Timing: Plant after main crop
- Incorporation: Before next planting

EFFICIENT WATER USE:
- Right timing: Early morning
- Right amount: Based on crop needs
- Right method: Drip for vegetables
- Right frequency: Based on soil type
- Right quality: Check water source

WATER QUALITY:

TESTING PARAMETERS:
