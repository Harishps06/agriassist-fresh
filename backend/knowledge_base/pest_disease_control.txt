ORGANIC PEST CONTROL:

NEEM-BASED CONTROL:
- Neem Oil: 2ml per liter water
- Neem Cake: 100kg per hectare
- Neem Leaves: Mulching and tea
- Azadirachtin: Commercial neem products

BOTANICAL PESTICIDES:
- Garlic Extract: 10g per liter water
- Chili Extract: 5g per liter water
- Onion Extract: 20g per liter water
- Tobacco Extract: 50g per liter water

BIOLOGICAL CONTROL:
- Trichogramma: For stem borers
- Chrysoperla: For aphids and whiteflies
- Lady Beetles: For soft-bodied insects
- Parasitic Wasps: For caterpillars

CULTURAL PRACTICES:
- Crop Rotation: Break pest cycles
- Intercropping: Confuse pests
- Sanitation: Remove infected parts
- Proper Spacing: Reduce humidity
- Timely Planting: Avoid peak pest periods

CHEMICAL CONTROL (Last Resort):
- Pyrethroids: Contact insecticides
- Organophosphates: Systemic action
- Carbamates: Quick knockdown
- Neonicotinoids: Systemic, long-lasting
- Always follow label instructions

DISEASE MANAGEMENT:

PREVENTION:
- Use disease-free seeds
- Proper spacing for air circulation
- Avoid overhead irrigation
- Remove infected plant parts
- Clean tools and equipment

TREATMENT:
- Copper Fungicides: For bacterial diseases
- Sulfur: For powdery mildew
- Bordeaux Mixture: For fungal diseases
- Systemic Fungicides: For internal infections

RESISTANT VARIETIES:
- Choose disease-resistant varieties
- Rotate different varieties
- Use certified seeds
- Maintain genetic diversity

INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM):
- Monitor pest populations
- Use economic thresholds
- Combine different control methods
- Regular field scouting
- Record keeping

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS:
- Wear protective clothing
- Follow label instructions
- Don't mix incompatible chemicals
- Store pesticides safely
- Dispose of containers properly

ORGANIC CERTIFICATION:
- No synthetic pesticides
- Use only approved inputs
- Maintain records
- Regular inspections
- 3-year conversion period

EMERGENCY CONTROLS:
- Hand picking: For large pests
- Water spray: For small insects
- Sticky traps: For flying insects
- Light traps: For night-flying pests
